This means the fund owns a significant portion of the company’s shares but does not actively manage or influence company decisions related to those shares.\n\nTo break it down: a passive stake indicates ownership without direct involvement in the company’s daily operations or strategic planning.

Investors and analysts watch these stakes closely, as they can sometimes signal confidence in a company’s prospects or hint at future moves.\n\nIn summary, Bigger Capital Fund LP now holds an 8 percent passive interest in Akers Biosciences, reflecting a notable investment position as of December 2017.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS gained 0.61 percent. The index had set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value in 2017.\nMajor stock indexes closed 2017 with their best performance since 2013. In the U.S. market, the advance came amid strong economic growth and corporate earnings, low interest rates and hopes, now realized, of U.S. corporate tax cuts.\nU.S. equity indexes advanced on Tuesday, buoyed by gains in technology and consumer discretionary stocks.\nIncreases in Apple ( AAPL.O ), Facebook ( FB.O ), Alphabet ( GOOGL.O ) and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) shares pulled the S&P 500 index higher on Tuesday.\n“People are back to looking at what have been the winners. It has been very momentum driven,” said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 59.79 points, or 0.24 percent, to 24,779.01, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 17.15 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,690.76 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 91.91 points, or 1.33 percent, to 6,995.30.\nIn Europe, equities closed lower after autos stocks fell following weaker car registrations data. Trading was also cautious ahead of the launch of a major reform of European financial markets.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.21 percent along with euro zone stocks .STOXXE, down 0.19 percent.\nShares rose in Asia. Shanghai blue chips .CSI300 climbed 1.41 percent and MSCI's 24-country emerging market stock index .MSCIEF jumped to a multi-year high after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline.\nFALLING DOLLAR The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.23 percent. It was hampered by market expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture.\nThe dollar had already hit a three-month low .DXY on Friday, bringing its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worst performance since 2003.\nOther currencies gained. The euro EUR= rose 0.3 percent to $1.2044 and hit a four-month high on Tuesday after data showed that euro zone manufacturers ramped up activity last month at the fastest pace in more than two decades.\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.28 percent at 112.35 per dollar, while sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3594, up 0.69 percent on the day.\nU.S. Treasury yields rose in line with European government yields. A European Central Bank official said the bank’s massive bond purchase program might not continue later this year.\nA reversal of year-end buying has also driven U.S. Treasury yields higher, said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.\n“Lots of institutions buy Treasuries to hold over year-end for liquidity. To see that reversal early in the year is not a surprise,” Rehling said.\nBenchmark U.S. 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 16/32 in price to yield 2.4687 percent, from 2.411 percent late on Friday.\nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 45/32 in price to yield 2.8105 percent, from 2.741 percent late on Friday.\nU.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.13 percent to $60.34 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was at $66.52, down 0.52 percent. Oil prices earlier had enjoyed their strongest start to a year since 2014 amid large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.\nCopper CMCU3 lost 0.42 percent to $7,216.50 a tonne, but that follows a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top.\nSpot gold XAU= added 1.0 percent to $1,315.15 an ounce, after advancing by 13 percent in 2017 for its best performance in seven years.\nAdditional reporting by Marc Jones, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Helen Reid in London, Henning Gloystein in Singapore, Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru, and Richard Leong and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s market update. We’re diving into how global financial markets kicked off 2018, with some interesting moves across stocks, currencies, and commodities.\n\nLet’s start with the big picture. On the first trading day of the year, European stocks closed lower, while U.S. markets moved higher. Wall Street’s gains were driven largely by strong performances in technology and consumer discretionary sectors. Major players like Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, and Microsoft helped push the S&P 500 upward.\n\nIn numbers, the Dow Jones rose about 60 points, the S&P 500 gained over 17 points, and the Nasdaq jumped nearly 92 points. This momentum reflects a continuation of trends from 2017, a year when U.S. markets saw their best returns since 2013. Factors like solid economic growth, robust corporate earnings, low interest rates, and the anticipated—and now realized—corporate tax cuts all played a role.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, European stocks faced some headwinds. Auto stocks dropped after weaker car registration data came in, and investors were cautious ahead of significant reforms planned for European financial markets. The STOXX 600 index slipped just under a quarter of a percent.\n\nMeanwhile in Asia, markets were on the rise. Chinese industrial activity surprised to the upside, pushing Shanghai’s blue-chip stocks higher and lifting emerging market indexes to multi-year highs.\n\nTurning to currencies, the U.S. dollar weakened to its lowest point in over three months against major currencies. This decline is tied to expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more slowly this year due to subdued inflation. The dollar’s drop last year was notable—nearly a 10 percent loss in 2017—the worst since 2003.\n\nIn contrast, the euro strengthened to a four-month high after data showed eurozone manufacturers expanding at their fastest pace in more than two decades. The Japanese yen and British pound also gained ground against the dollar.\n\nOn the bond front, yields on U.S. Treasury notes climbed along with European government bonds. This rise partly reflects a reversal of typical year-end buying patterns for Treasuries and hints from European Central Bank officials that their massive bond-buying program may wind down later this year.\n\nFinally, commodity prices showed mixed signals. Oil prices dipped slightly after a strong start to the year fueled by geopolitical tensions and supply cuts from OPEC and Russia. Copper prices eased back a bit following a significant rally last year, while gold continued its upward trend with a one percent gain on the day.\n\nTo sum up, early 2018 saw U.S. stocks gaining momentum led by tech giants, cautious moves in Europe amid economic data and regulatory changes, a softer dollar reflecting changing Fed expectations, and mixed but generally positive signals in commodities. It’s a complex but fascinating start to the new trading year.\n\nThanks for tuning in today—stay curious and informed as we keep an eye on how these trends develop."}]}

But if you watched President Donald Trump touting his recently passed tax cuts outside Pittsburgh, Pa., you might never have known it.\nOver the course of a 20-minute speech at a heavy-equipment manufacturing plant, Trump, who read from a teleprompter, didn't mention the looming closure of government once. \"Who knows?\" Before the speech, Trump said, \"Who knows?\" when reporters asked if he thought the federal government would be forced to close.\nThe president has consistently claimed that Democrats in Congress actually want a government shutdown, in order to detract attention away from the recently enacted Republican tax cuts.\nDemocrats are insisting that DACA protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children be extended as part of any longer-term spending bill. Both Trump and Republican leaders have previously said they would support a fix to keep the 800,000 immigrants from being at risk of deportation.\nMandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks during a tour of the H&K Equipment Company in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania on January 18, 2018. But last week, Trump rejected a bipartisan Senate group's immigration deal that lawmakers said would have enshrined DACA protections and would have met Trump's demands, which included funding for a barrier on the Southern border, and changes to extended family migration and the visa \"lottery.\"\nEver since then, the White House has put out mixed messages about what Trump wants, sowing confusion in Congress and angering lawmakers in both parties.\n\"I'm looking for something that President Trump supports,\" Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday, \"and he's not yet indicated what measure he's willing to sign.\"\nA government shutdown would mean hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be forced to go without pay, and important public services would be suspended. Lawmakers are desperate to avoid this scenario, as well as the resulting public backlash.\nBut judging from the president's twitter account – an often instantaneous reflection of what Trump is thinking about – Trump isn't nearly as desperate. Only three of the 36 tweets from Trump's account this week mentioned the word \"shutdown,\" and two sought to blame Democrats. One of them, on Thursday, made a shutdown sound all but inevitable.\nTrump tweet\nComplicating matters for Republicans is Trump's well documented willingness to blame members of his own party when it is politically expedient for him to do so.\nDuring last year's failed repeal of Obamacare, Trump refused to take responsibility for the legislative breakdown, blaming GOP lawmakers instead.\n\"I'm not going to blame myself. I'll be honest, they are not getting the job done,\" Trump told reporters at a Cabinet meeting in October, adding that some Republicans, \"should be ashamed of themselves.\"\nAlready on Thursday, the White House appeared to be downplaying the impact of a possible shutdown, while at the same time preparing to lay blame on Congress if the government shuts down. \"We're all focused myopically on what is happening today and whether the government will shut down,\" While House legislative director Marc Short told Politico. \"What's missing from this conversation is the complete dysfunction ofd Congress, and its inability to complete the appropriations process.\"\nAs if on cue, less than an hour before a scheduled House vote on a spending bill Thursday night, Trump tweeted at lawmakers. \"Our military needs it!\" he wrote.\nTRUMP tweet\nTrump, meanwhile, is scheduled to leave Washington on Friday afternoon for his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he will mark the one-year anniversary of his inauguration by holding a fundraiser. A White House spokesman would not not say on Friday whether he plans to change his travel plans if Congress doesn't reach a deal.\nWATCH: What happens when the government shuts down\nshow chapters This is what happens when the U.S. government shuts down 6 Hours Ago | 02:07\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about the tense moments in Washington, D.C., when a government shutdown loomed large—but the president seemed almost unfazed.\n\nOn one side, House and Senate leaders were scrambling to negotiate a spending bill to keep the government running. Federal agencies were bracing for the possibility of furloughing workers if no agreement was reached. This is serious stuff—shutdowns mean hundreds of thousands of federal employees might go without pay, and vital public services could grind to a halt.\n\nYet, at the same time, President Trump was giving a 20-minute speech at a manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania. Throughout his remarks, he didn’t mention the shutdown even once. When asked earlier if he thought the government would close, he simply said, “Who knows?” Instead, he focused on promoting the recently passed tax cuts.\n\nBehind the scenes, the sticking point was immigration protections under DACA—the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program—which protects around 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Democrats insisted that any long-term spending bill must include DACA protections. Trump and Republican leaders had previously expressed support for a fix, but last week Trump rejected a bipartisan Senate immigration deal that would have secured those protections while also addressing his demands like border wall funding and changes to family migration and visa policies.\n\nThis back-and-forth created confusion and frustration in Congress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell admitted he was still waiting to hear what measure Trump would actually sign. Meanwhile, Trump’s tweets showed little urgency about avoiding a shutdown—in fact, most blamed Democrats for the stalemate, and one tweet even suggested a shutdown was likely.\n\nAdding to the complexity is Trump’s readiness to blame even members of his own party when it suits him politically. During last year’s failed Obamacare repeal effort, for example, he publicly faulted Republican lawmakers rather than himself.\n\nAs lawmakers worked against the clock to prevent a shutdown and its fallout, the White House downplayed its impact and prepared to shift blame onto Congress if things fell apart. And all this unfolded just before a crucial House vote on funding.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump planned to leave Washington for his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida to mark the one-year anniversary of his inauguration with a fundraiser—without any clear indication he’d change those plans if no deal was reached.\n\nSo, what does this all tell us? The threat of a government shutdown brought urgent negotiations and tough stances on immigration and spending. But from the president’s perspective, there was a different focus—promoting achievements like tax cuts and deflecting blame—leaving much uncertainty about how or when this political standoff might resolve.\n\nThat’s where things stood as Washington faced one of its recurring challenges: balancing political priorities with the practical need to keep government running smoothly."}]}

He also took home a Golden Globe and numerous trophies from film critics groups. \nThe win came despite 2010 sexual harassment accusations that resurfaced in the run-up to the ceremony. Two lawsuits alleging unwanted advances were filed by female crew members on another movie and were settled out of court for undisclosed sums. \nAn attorney for Affleck denied the accusations at the time. \nAffleck adopts a lower public profile than his brother Ben and appears uncomfortable in the spotlight. He was first nominated for an Oscar in 2008 for his lead role in “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.” \nWhile Ben Affleck has opted for big movies like “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” Casey Affleck has focused his career on smaller, independent ventures with strong character-driven plots such as “Gone Baby Gone.” \nIn 2010, he wrote and directed Joaquin Phoenix in “I‘m Still Here,” a mockumentary about Phoenix’s supposed transition from acting to becoming a rap musician. \nTwo years ago he quietly separated from his wife, actress Summer Phoenix, after a nine-year marriage that produced two sons.

You might remember Affleck from his acclaimed role in \"Manchester by the Sea,\" which earned him the Best Actor Oscar last year. But recently, he made the decision to withdraw as a presenter at this year’s Oscars ceremony.\n\nSo, what’s going on here? Typically, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences invites recent winners to present awards the following year. Affleck was set to present the Best Actress award at the ceremony scheduled for March 4th at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. However, a spokeswoman for the Academy announced that he would no longer be participating as a presenter. The reason given was a desire to keep the focus on the show and the achievements being celebrated this year.\n\nThis decision comes against the backdrop of past accusations against Affleck. Back in 2010, two female crew members filed lawsuits alleging unwanted advances during earlier film projects. These cases were settled out of court, and Affleck’s attorney denied the accusations at that time. Despite these controversies, Affleck won numerous awards for his performance in \"Manchester by the Sea,\" including a Golden Globe and several critics’ awards.\n\nCasey Affleck is known for maintaining a lower profile compared to his brother Ben Affleck. While Ben often stars in large blockbuster films, Casey tends to choose smaller, independent movies with strong character-driven stories. His career includes directing and writing projects too, like the mockumentary \"I'm Still Here,\" featuring Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nIn summary, Casey Affleck’s withdrawal from presenting at the Oscars reflects an effort to keep attention on the ceremony itself amid past controversies. It’s a reminder of how personal histories can intersect with public events in complex ways, especially in an industry as visible as Hollywood."}]}

EU officials say that might, for example, include regular reviews of the performance of national justice systems, along the lines of existing biennial reviews of government economic policies, which are meant to promote “convergence” toward EU-wide goals. \nAs a former national official handling the regional funding that is a key part of EU efforts to bring poor regions closer to the prosperity of others, Jourova stressed that she saw any new rules applying to all EU funding for all states, not just to so-called “cohesion” policy. She also said it should not be seen as a punitive measure but designed to encourage good practice. \nShe also said discussion on the proposals could be used to help simplify some of the hurdles to applying for EU funds. \nAny Commission proposal seen as too radical by governments risk being killed off by member states. Reporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Catherine Evans\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into an important development within the European Union that links the rule of law to funding. The EU is considering a new approach that could change how member states receive financial support, especially in cases where judicial independence is in question.\n\nHere’s what’s happening. The EU’s justice commissioner, Vera Jourova, is working on a proposal aimed at ensuring that countries uphold independent judicial systems before they get EU funds. This idea comes amid ongoing tensions with countries like Poland, which has faced criticism from Brussels over reforms seen as undermining the independence of its courts.\n\nThe core of the proposal is straightforward: member states would need to demonstrate that their judicial systems are independent and effective in overseeing the use of EU money. If they can’t, their access to funding might be restricted. This is part of a broader plan connected to the EU’s next seven-year budget cycle starting in 2021.\n\nWhy does this matter? Well, with Britain leaving the EU and creating a financial gap, some wealthier Western countries want to ensure that subsidies go only to governments that respect EU standards, including the rule of law. The German commissioner responsible for the budget has already warned Poland it could lose billions in funding if it doesn’t address these concerns.\n\nBut this isn’t just about punishment. Jourova emphasizes that any new rules would apply across all EU funding streams and are meant to encourage best practices rather than serve as a penalty. There’s even talk of regular reviews of national judicial systems, similar to how economic policies are evaluated every two years, aiming to promote convergence toward shared EU goals.\n\nAdditionally, these discussions might help simplify the often complex process of applying for EU funds, making it easier for all member states to participate.\n\nTo sum up, the European Commission is exploring ways to tie financial support directly to the strength and independence of judicial systems in member countries. It’s a move designed to uphold democratic standards and ensure EU funds are used responsibly while encouraging good governance across the union."}]}

Specifically, we’ll look at how the company responded to suggestions from investor Carl Icahn, who proposed changes to the board and certain governance policies.\n\nSo, what’s going on here? Sandridge Energy recently held meetings with its large shareholders, including Icahn, who put forward a few proposals. Among these were replacing two of the five current board members and changing some company bylaws related to major acquisitions. Icahn also proposed ending the company’s short-term shareholder rights plan or raising the threshold that triggers it.\n\nAfter careful consideration, Sandridge’s board decided not to accept Icahn’s proposals. They concluded that replacing two directors wasn’t in the best interests of the company. Similarly, they rejected changes to the bylaws requiring supermajority votes on big acquisitions. And when it came to the short-term shareholder rights plan—which is designed to protect against sudden takeovers—the board chose not to terminate it or raise the trigger all the way to 25 percent as Icahn suggested.\n\nInstead, the board opted for a compromise. They plan to amend the rights plan by increasing the trigger threshold to 15 percent and removing language about shareholders “acting in concert.” This adjustment reflects a middle ground between maintaining protections and addressing some concerns raised.\n\nImportantly, Sandridge made it clear that it remains open to considering any premium takeover offers from any party, including Mr. Icahn himself. So while they’re holding firm on current governance structures for now, they’re not closing the door on potential future deals that could benefit shareholders.\n\nIn summary, Sandridge Energy has weighed investor proposals carefully and decided against major changes to its board or bylaws at this time. Instead, it’s making more measured adjustments to its shareholder rights plan while remaining open to takeover offers that could add value. It’s a reminder of how companies balance differing views from investors while aiming to protect long-term interests."}]}

(\"Spark\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:SPKE), an independent retail energy services company, announced today that the Company and Verde Energy USA Holdings, LLC (“Verde”) have agreed to terminate the earnout provisions of the purchase and sale transaction in which Spark acquired Verde’s operating subsidiaries in July 2017.\nPursuant to the Membership Interest and Stock Purchase Agreement (“MIPA”) entered into between the Company, its subsidiary, and Verde on May 5, 2017, the Company was obligated to pay 100% of the Adjusted EBITDA earned by the Verde Companies for the 18 months following closing that exceeds certain thresholds, subject to the Verde Companies’ ability to achieve defined customer count criteria. In connection with such obligations, Verde’s existing management continued to operate the business as a separate entity during the earnout period. The buyout transaction provides for a lump sum payment of approximately $6.0 million in June 2019 in substitution of the existing earnout obligations. With the buyout of the earnout provision, Spark management will assume complete control over Verde’s operations, effective immediately.\n“The early buyout of the Verde earnout gives us the opportunity to begin immediate improvement in our bottom line results,” said Nathan Kroeker, Spark Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “As I mentioned on our last earnings call, one of our near-term strategic priorities is to maximize process efficiencies and synergies through the integration of recent acquisitions. By ending the Verde earnout almost a year early, we are able to accelerate and realize synergies of the acquisition that should increase our Adjusted EBITDA performance in future periods.”\nAbout Spark Energy, Inc.\nSpark Energy, Inc. is an established and growing independent retail energy services company founded in 1999 that provides residential and commercial customers in competitive markets across the United States with an alternative choice for their natural gas and electricity.

This update centers on their acquisition of Verde Energy USA Holdings and an important change to the terms of that deal.\n\nBack in July 2017, Spark Energy acquired Verde’s operating subsidiaries. As part of that agreement, there was an earnout provision in place. Essentially, Spark agreed to pay Verde an amount tied to Verde’s financial performance—specifically, 100% of the adjusted EBITDA over certain thresholds for 18 months after the acquisition. During this period, Verde's management continued running the business separately.\n\nHowever, Spark and Verde recently decided to end this earnout arrangement early. Instead of continuing with the performance-based payments, Spark will make a one-time lump sum payment of about $6 million in June 2019. With this buyout, Spark takes full control over Verde’s operations immediately.\n\nWhy does this matter? According to Nathan Kroeker, Spark’s President and CEO, ending the earnout early allows Spark to start improving its financial results sooner. It also helps them integrate Verde more efficiently and capture cost savings or synergies faster than originally planned. This move aligns with Spark’s broader strategy to streamline operations and boost profitability following recent acquisitions.\n\nTo give a quick background, Spark Energy has been around since 1999 and serves residential and commercial customers across 19 states.

On Thursday, the group moved the “ Doomsday Clock ,” its symbolic predictor of the likelihood of nuclear apocalypse, to “2 minutes to midnight.” The new setting is 30 seconds closer to catastrophe than last year, signaling that the world is as close to nuclear disaster, in the group’s assessment, as it has ever been.\nThe Economist, in highlighting higher risk of global conflict, cites the Pentagon’s new national defense strategy , which identifies “great power competition” between the US, China and Russia as the “central challenge to US prosperity and security.” The report deems China and Russia greater threats to US security than jihadism. ( Fortune flagged that report for CEO Daily readers last week.)\nThe Economist cites North Korea as the world’s most immediate security flashpoint. But it twits US president Donald Trump’s refusal to uphold America’s traditional role as world leader as the main long-run threat to global stability. “Mr Trump says he wants to make America great again, but is going about it in exactly the wrong way,” Economist editors opine. “He shuns multilateral organizations, treats alliances as unwanted baggage and openly admires the authoritarian leaders of America's adversaries. It is as if Mr Trump wants America to give up defending the system it created and to join Russia and China as just another truculent revisionist power instead.”\nStrong stuff. Officials from the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists also decry American abdication of global leadership under Trump as a key source of global instability.\nTrump’s decision this week to impose steep tariffs on imports of washing machines and solar panels did little to allay such concerns. A host of publications, including the BBC and Bloomberg , warned that, should push come to shove, China has many options for retaliation in a trade war. Former Morgan Stanley economist Stephen Roach, in an essay entitled “How to Lose a Trade War,” decried Trump’s trade policies as “backward looking at best” and putting growth of the US economy at risk.\nTrump himself seems unfazed by such concerns.

There’s a lot unfolding on the world stage that’s worth unpacking—from concerns about potential large-scale conflict to the shifting dynamics in trade and technology.\n\nLet’s start with the big picture on global security. Recent reports warn that major shifts in geopolitics and new technologies are challenging America’s long-held dominance. Experts suggest that a conflict on a scale not seen since World War II could be possible again—and the world isn’t ready for it. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists even moved their symbolic Doomsday Clock closer to midnight, indicating we’re as close to nuclear disaster as ever.\n\nThe Pentagon’s latest defense strategy highlights “great power competition” as the central challenge, focusing on the US, China, and Russia. Interestingly, it views China and Russia as bigger threats than terrorism. North Korea remains a flashpoint, but some analysts see US President Donald Trump’s approach—shunning alliances and multilateral organizations—as a long-term risk to global stability. Critics argue this stance could weaken the system America helped build and inadvertently boost rivals like China and Russia.\n\nOn the economic front, Trump’s recent tariffs on washing machines and solar panels have sparked warnings about possible retaliation from China. Some economists say these trade policies might hurt US economic growth rather than protect it. Despite these concerns, Trump remains optimistic, telling the World Economic Forum in Davos that America’s economy is “roaring back” and open for business.\n\nMeanwhile, at Davos, Chinese leaders presented a contrasting vision. They emphasized a “shared future” outlook, promoting openness and reform. China’s top financial advisor promised new reforms this year that could exceed international expectations, marking four decades since China shifted from a closed economy. Chinese business figures also cautioned against protectionism and trade wars, highlighting how such moves could backfire globally.\n\nTechnology is another area where US-China competition is heating up. Chinese companies are expanding their influence—Tencent investing in Hollywood projects, Buzzfeed partnering with Beijing-based platforms, and major players like JD.com and Didi Chuxing growing their services rapidly.\n\nTo sum up, we’re seeing a world at a crossroads—where geopolitical rivalry, economic policies, and technological competition are intertwining in complex ways. The choices made now by global leaders will shape not just markets but the broader stability of international relations in the years ahead.\n\nThanks for listening.

FILE PHOTO: A driver reads a newspaper as he sits on a spare tire attached to a parked oil tanker at a truck terminal in Mumbai, India, January 10, 2018. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/File Photo \nInternational benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 last traded 29 cents higher at $70.16 by 1937 GMT, having risen to a high of $70.37 a barrel earlier in the session. \nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 gained 51 cents at $64.81 a barrel. Both benchmarks hit levels not seen since December 2014, although trading was thin due to a holiday in the United States. \nA production-cutting pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers has given a strong tailwind to oil prices. \nGrowing signs of a tightening market after a three-year rout have bolstered confidence among traders and analysts. \n“It’s catching a lot of people by surprise and I think (prices) are sustainable,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. “We’re seeing the reality of strong demand and declining supplies.” \nBank of America Merrill Lynch on Monday raised its 2018 Brent price forecast to $64 a barrel from $56, forecasting a deficit of 430,000 barrels per day (bpd) in oil production compared to demand this year. \n“OPEC and non-OPEC producers remain committed to production cuts at the same time world oil demand continues to increase,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. \n“As we go through 2018, the market is also going to continue to look at geopolitical supply disruptions that could occur in Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela.” RED FLAG \nStill, some analysts have warned that the 13 percent rally since the start of the year could peter out due to global refinery maintenance and rising North American production. \nU.S. energy companies added 10 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 12, taking the number to 752, energy service firm Baker Hughes ( GE.N ) said on Friday. \nThat was the biggest increase since June 2017. \nIn Canada, energy firms almost doubled the number of rigs drilling for oil last week to 185, the highest level in 10 months. \nVienna-based consultancy JBC Energy expects U.S. production to grow by 600,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a year earlier. \n“From a fundamental perspective, the surge in U.S. managed money raises a clear red flag for us. We see the U.S. complex as decidedly bearish over the next two months.” \nBut Flynn said a fast climb in U.S. output is not so clear. \n“The realities of the shale market are starting to sink in. Shale producers have to add a lot of rigs, frack crews and add a lot of investment. It takes time to raise that production.”   Ron Bousso in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Louise Heavens and Bill Trott\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oil prices have been making headlines lately, hovering near a three-year high above $70 a barrel. So, what’s driving this surge, and what might it mean for the future? Today, let’s break down the key factors behind these rising oil prices and what challenges lie ahead.\n\nFirst off, a big part of the story comes down to supply cuts. A group of major oil producers—including OPEC countries and Russia—have agreed to reduce their output. This move is tightening the global supply of oil, giving prices a strong boost. Traders and analysts are noticing this shift. There’s growing confidence that the market is tightening after years of low prices, thanks to both stronger demand and less supply.\n\nFor example, Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently raised its forecast for Brent crude oil prices this year, expecting a tighter market with production falling short of demand by hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. Experts also point out that ongoing geopolitical issues in places like Libya, Nigeria, and Venezuela could further disrupt supply and support higher prices.\n\nBut it’s not all straightforward. On the flip side, U.S. oil production is ramping up quickly. Energy companies there are adding rigs at the fastest pace in months, and Canadian drilling activity is also increasing. This surge in North American production has some analysts warning that it could cap price gains or even push prices down in the near term.\n\nStill, others caution that boosting shale oil output isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. It requires significant investment, more rigs, and time to bring new production online. So while U.S. output is growing, it may not immediately offset the effects of the production cuts elsewhere.\n\nIn summary, oil prices are climbing due to coordinated supply cuts and steady demand growth, but rising U.S. production introduces some uncertainty. The market is balancing these opposing forces, making it an interesting time to watch how oil prices evolve in the months ahead."}]}

This growing sector is eager to expand its workforce, particularly with English-speaking employees.\n\nSo, what’s driving this opportunity? El Salvador’s call centers have been on the rise, becoming an important part of the country’s economy. These centers often serve international clients, which means they need workers fluent in English. Returning Salvadorans, having lived and worked in the U.S., often bring that valuable language ability.\n\nFor those forced to leave the U.S., this development could offer a smoother transition back home. Instead of struggling to find work, they might step into roles where their bilingual skills are in high demand. It’s a chance not only for employment but also for contributing to a growing industry within El Salvador.\n\nIn summary, as some Salvadorans prepare to return from abroad, El Salvador’s expanding call center sector stands ready to welcome them with open arms—offering jobs that match their unique skills and experiences. It’s a reminder of how changing circumstances can open new doors closer to home."}]}

Today, we’re diving into a recent college basketball matchup where Clemson took on Notre Dame in an Atlantic Coast Conference game that had plenty of action and some notable storylines.\n\nSo, here’s what happened. Clemson, ranked 20th, hosted Notre Dame at Littlejohn Coliseum and came away with a solid 67-58 win. This victory marked a few milestones for Clemson. They improved their overall record to 16-3 and their ACC record to 5-2. Impressively, they remain undefeated at home this season, now 11-0, and undefeated in ACC games at Littlejohn Coliseum with a perfect 4-0. Plus, they finally beat Notre Dame for the first time in six attempts since Notre Dame joined the ACC five years ago.\n\nLet’s break down the game itself. Senior guard Gabe DeVoe led the charge for Clemson with 17 points. He was one of four Tigers scoring in double digits, alongside junior guard Shelton Mitchell with 12 points—10 of which came in the second half—Marcquise Reed also with 12, and senior forward Donte Grantham who added 11 points before an unfortunate knee injury sidelined him with about ten minutes left in the game.\n\nClemson started strong, making their first seven shots and jumping out to a quick 17-8 lead, largely thanks to DeVoe’s 14 first-half points. They stretched their lead up to 11 points several times but Notre Dame fought back late in the half to narrow the gap to just three points at halftime.\n\nThe second half saw Notre Dame get as close as one point at 47-46 with ten minutes remaining. But then Shelton Mitchell scored five straight points to help Clemson pull away again. In the final minutes, Notre Dame cut the lead to three again on a three-pointer by Matt Farrell, but Clemson freshman Aamir Simms hit his first career three-pointer at home to push the lead back out. The Tigers then sealed the win by hitting four of seven free throws in the last 46 seconds.\n\nOn Notre Dame’s side, freshman guard T.J. Gibbs led with 18 points, and sophomore John Mooney came off the bench to contribute a career-high 13 points. Senior forward Martinas Geben added 10 points and nine rebounds. Still, Notre Dame struggled overall with their shooting percentage at just under 39 percent, one of their lowest marks this season.\n\nSo, to sum it up: Clemson dominated at home once again with balanced scoring and strong defense that kept Notre Dame from taking the lead at any point. Despite losing Grantham late to injury, they held steady and earned a meaningful win over a tough conference opponent.\n\nThat’s all for today’s game recap. Thanks for listening!"}]}

Sen. Rob Portman , R-Ohio, says the best news is yet to come. \n\"I've talked to a number of CEOs over the past several months about the tax reform as it relates to international business. They can now be competitive here in America,\" Portman told CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" on Thursday. \n\"I think you'll see some big news coming up as to companies that are literally moving factories from overseas back to the United States,\" he said. \nA bevy of changes to the tax code at the individual, corporate and international level came into effect at the start of 2018. Large companies are getting a big cut to the corporate tax rate — down to 21 percent from 35 percent — and a new expensing period that allows them to deduct the cost of some assets. \nAnd a number of companies have announced perks and financial gifts for employees. Some of them have directly cited the new tax law as the reason for giving out bonuses or buying back stock. \nIn Portman's state, for instance, Columbus-based Nationwide Insurance announced on Wednesday that it will give a $1,000 bonus to most of its 33,000 employees. \nOther companies, such as Wells Fargo and Fifth Third , promised to raise their minimum wages in the wake of the new tax law. \nIndividual tax cuts and beefed-up deductions have also come into effect, though most of them will expire in 2025. \nPortman chalked up the unpopularity of the tax bill to the general distrust surrounding Washington, but reiterated the sense of corporate optimism he said he's witnessed since it became law. \n\"Companies that are invested in Ohio are now saying they're going to put more money into Ohio,\" Portman said. \"They're telling me that because the lower rates and the expensing makes it better to put an investment in America rather than in Japan or in China or in Germany.\" Kevin Breuninger Special to CNBC.com Related Securities\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s episode, where we’re diving into how recent tax reform is reshaping the business landscape in America. You might have heard about companies giving bonuses or raising wages, but there’s more happening beneath the surface that could signal a bigger shift in where and how businesses operate.\n\nSo, what’s going on? Let’s break it down.\n\nAt the start of 2018, sweeping changes to the tax code took effect. One of the biggest moves was slashing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. That’s a substantial cut, making it cheaper for companies to operate here in the U.S. On top of that, new rules allow businesses to deduct the cost of certain assets more quickly, encouraging investment.\n\nSenator Rob Portman from Ohio has been talking with CEOs who say these changes are making America more competitive internationally. In fact, he shared that some companies are considering moving factories back from overseas to the U.S. That’s a big deal because it means jobs and investments could be coming home.\n\nWe’re already seeing some early signs. For example, Nationwide Insurance, based in Columbus, Ohio, announced a $1,000 bonus for most of its 33,000 employees. Other firms like Wells Fargo and Fifth Third have promised to raise their minimum wages, directly linking these perks to the new tax law.\n\nIt’s not just corporations benefiting. Individual taxpayers are seeing cuts and enhanced deductions too, though many of these changes are set to expire in a few years.\n\nDespite some public skepticism about the tax bill—largely due to general distrust of Washington—business leaders seem optimistic. They’re telling Senator Portman that with lower rates and better expensing rules, investing in America makes more sense than putting money into countries like Japan, China, or Germany.\n\nTo sum it up: The recent tax reforms are not just about numbers on paper. They’re influencing real decisions by companies—leading to bonuses for workers, higher wages, and potentially even bringing manufacturing back home. It’s an evolving story worth watching as these changes take root.\n\nThanks for tuning in today. Until next time!"}]}

She did not provide details.\nLighthizer currently is preparing for the next round of NAFTA talks in Montreal. Washington has taken a hard line in the negotiations, which appear stalled with just two rounds of left, saying that concessions are the only way for Canada and Mexico to keep the deal.\nCanada this week welcomed Trump’s suggestion that NAFTA talks could be extended beyond March when Mexico’s presidential election campaign kicks into high gear.\nTrump’s opportunity to impose new tariffs or trade quotas follows a U.S. Commerce Department Section 232 investigation that looked into whether foreign steel imports are a threat to U.S. national security. The department submitted the long-awaited report to the White House on Thursday.\nNext week, the results of a separate investigation of rising aluminum imports will go to the White House.\nChina’s excess production capacity for both steel and aluminum has emerged as a major trade irritant for the United States and Europe, prompting them to consider new steps to protect domestic industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese imports.\nMeanwhile, China reported on Friday that exports and imports growth slowed in December after surging in the previous month, adding to signs of ebbing economic momentum as the government extends a crackdown on financial risks and factory pollution.\nA synchronized uptick in the global economy over the past year has been a boon to China and much of trade-dependent Asia, with Chinese exports in 2017 growing at their quickest pace in four years.\nThe sharp December imports slowdown, however, is raising concerns that the world’s second-biggest economy faces domestic-demand pressure as authorities turn off cheap credit and restrict speculative financing.\nReporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Will Dunham and Bill Trott\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into some important developments in U.S. trade policy and what they could mean for the global economy. Specifically, we’ll look at recent discussions between President Trump and his trade envoy, Robert Lighthizer, about trade with China and the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.\n\nSo, here’s the backdrop. President Trump met with Lighthizer at Mar-a-Lago to get updated on two key areas: ongoing trade talks with China and negotiations to revise NAFTA with Canada and Mexico. These discussions come at a time when the administration is considering new tariffs, especially on steel and aluminum imports, as well as potential punitive measures against China over allegations of intellectual property theft.\n\nLet’s break it down step by step. First, on NAFTA—the trade deal that’s been central to commerce between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico for decades. Negotiations have been tough, with the U.S. taking a firm stance that Canada and Mexico need to make concessions if they want to keep the agreement intact. Right now, talks seem stalled, with only a couple of negotiation rounds left before a deadline in March. Interestingly, Canada recently welcomed President Trump’s openness to possibly extending these talks beyond March, especially since Mexico is gearing up for a presidential election campaign.\n\nThen there’s the issue of steel and aluminum imports. The Commerce Department recently wrapped up a key investigation into whether foreign steel poses a national security threat—a process known as Section 232. The report has been submitted to the White House, and next week, a similar investigation into aluminum imports will be delivered. These probes come amid concerns about China’s excess production capacity in these metals, which has led to a flood of imports affecting domestic industries in both the U.S. and Europe.\n\nOn the other side of the Pacific, China is showing signs of economic slowing. In December, their exports and imports growth slowed after a strong surge the previous month. This slowdown raises questions about domestic demand within China as its government tightens financial regulations and targets factory pollution. While Chinese exports had their fastest growth in four years during 2017, this recent dip suggests some economic headwinds ahead.\n\nTo sum up, the U.S. is at a crossroads with trade policy—balancing tough negotiations on NAFTA with potential new tariffs aimed at protecting key industries from foreign competition. Meanwhile, shifts in China’s economic momentum add another layer of complexity to global trade dynamics. How these factors play out will be crucial for businesses and consumers alike in the months ahead."}]}

(Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Greg Stutchbury)\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s dive into an exciting moment from the Australian Open, where resilience and determination took center stage on the tennis court.\n\nWe’re talking about Spain’s Carla Suarez Navarro, who became the first player to reach the quarter-finals at this Grand Slam event. Her journey to get there wasn’t easy—she had to come from behind against Estonia’s Anett Kontaveit in a thrilling match that tested both players’ nerves.\n\nKontaveit started strong. She won the first set 6-4 and then surged ahead in the second, breaking Suarez Navarro twice to lead 4-1. At that point, it looked like Kontaveit might secure her first-ever Grand Slam quarter-final. But then something shifted. A double fault from Kontaveit handed a crucial break back to Suarez Navarro, and the 29-year-old Spaniard seized the opportunity. She fought back to take the second set 6-4, leveling the match.\n\nThe deciding set was a tense back-and-forth battle. Kontaveit managed to break Suarez Navarro at 4-4, appearing close to victory again. However, when serving for the match, she faltered and was broken in return. Then came a stroke of incredible luck for Suarez Navarro: at 6-7 in the final set, Kontaveit served a forehand that hit the net tape twice before barely crossing over, giving Suarez Navarro another chance.\n\nThough Suarez Navarro missed her first match point after that lucky shot, she didn’t give up. On her third opportunity, Kontaveit hit a forehand long, handing Suarez Navarro the win. This victory sends Suarez Navarro into the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park for the third time in her career. Next up for her is either second seed Caroline Wozniacki or Magdalena Rybarikova.\n\nIn summary, this match was a perfect example of how persistence and composure can turn a game around—even when things seem out of reach. Carla Suarez Navarro’s comeback not only highlights her skill but also reminds us why tennis is such an unpredictable and captivating sport."}]}

Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net PRESSURE'S ON: EUROPEAN EARNINGS IN THE SPOTLIGHT (1500 GMT) The pressure is on for European equities in 2018 to deliver a convincing sequel to last year's impressive earnings comeback. The recovery in earnings underpins investors' conviction the region is a buy, and should the numbers show signs of fading, international and cross-asset investors may start pulling back. \"In Europe we'd had an absence of top line growth. Our hope and belief is now as that top line growth reappears there should be some decent operating leverage to come through,\" says Marcus Morris-Eyton, portfolio manager, European equities at Allianz Global Investors. Valuations still make Europe relatively attractive, too. \"In Europe you have valuations at a 30 percent discount to U.S.\" Investors' hopes for European earnings come against a backdrop of global earnings expectations also rising strongly (see chart) - but Europe, the latest to emerge from its drawn-out earnings slump, is particularly feeling the heat. (Helen Reid) STOXX 600 ON TRACK FOR WORST DAY IN SIX WEEKS (1412 GMT) Whether you prefer calling it a 'correction' or a 'blip', things have taken a turn for the worse in afternoon trading. The STOXX 600 just hit a session low and is now trading down 0.8 percent, on track for its biggest one-day fall in six weeks, since Dec 20. Banks and miners are still leading the slide which accelerated as U.S. futures sank. The bank sector is down 1.4 percent and set for its worst fall in five months. Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures are trading down 0.7 to 1 percent as the rise in bond yields weighs and Apple again falls 1.1 percent in premarket trading. The VIX index of S&P 500 volatility has crept up to its highest level since Dec 1, crossing the 14 mark for the first time in nearly two months. Just as, with January nearing a close, New Year greetings and resolutions go stale, so the New Year 'melt-up' seems to have reached an existential impasse. (Helen Reid) LOOKING FOR HEDGES? CONSIDER THE SMI (1320 GMT) Rising bond yields, trade war worries, stretched stock valuations have generated a mild risk-off mood and with the \"correction\" word sneaking back into market commentary, fund managers are looking for ways to protect their portfolios. Strategists at Natixis recommend considering Switzerland and its top share index SMI as they draw a comparison to Japan's Nikkei. Japan and Switzerland both enjoy currencies with a safe haven status, making their equity markets an interesting case but Natixis has found a key difference. \"It is no secret that JPY and Nikkei Index are inversely correlated. Businesses in Japan have enjoyed benefits from cheaper currency and expansionary monetary policy. On the other hand, SMI Index and CHF have not shown strong relation to one another,\" they say. \"Switzerland’s export GDP growth has been similar to that of Japan and the two central banks conducted an asset purchasing program, though SNB operated in a quiet and discreet way during 2009-2010, with a negative policy rate. Factors for JPY and Nikkei correlation have not had an impact on the Swiss financial market,\" they add. As a result the SMI could be a relatively good bet even when risk-off is on the rise. \"In addition to a stronger performance during risk-on periods, the SMI index also provides greater excess return than Nikkei during risk-off periods,\" they conclude. (Danilo Masoni) **** MEANWHILE, THE EURO BREAK-UP INDEX HITS AN ALL-TIME LOW (1254 GMT) \"At the beginning of 2018 the euro zone is more robust than ever,\" writes behavioural finance analysis house sentix. Its Euro Break-Up Index has hit its lowest ever level, indicating investors are less fearful than ever of the currency union unravelling. This month's reading shows that just 6.9 percent of all surveyed investors expect the euro to break up in the next 12 months. That compares to the high of 73 percent in July 2012 in the depths of the euro zone debt crisis. The one area of concern? Italy: sentix's sub-index for the country rose this month to 5.22%, meaning investors see it \"as most likely to be regarded as a candidate for exit from the euro\". Analysts at sentix expect this to increase until Italy's election on March 4. (Helen Reid) EUROPEAN EQUITIES: GROWTH VS VALUE (1207) As we pointed out in yesterday's blog, years of low interest rates helped propel the performance of growth stocks as investors were happy to buy into the promise of future earnings. The rise in bond yields may increase the appeal of \"jam today\" in he form of \"value\" stocks. Allianz Global Investors is watching carefully to see if bond yields are rising more because of solid economic growth, or due to an inflation risk coupled with subdued growth. If it’s the former, “then people won’t want to pay so much of a premium for resilient growth if they can get more cyclical recovery,” said Simon Gergel, Chief Investment Officer for UK Equities. If the latter, “then I think the typical growth stocks will probably do better”. Gergel sees the UK market polarized between higher growth international companies that are seen as more resilient like Unilever or Diageo and then smaller domestic cyclical players facing the brunt of Brexit economic risk and a potential change of government. Among Gergel’s more recent buys: Barclays, Bovis Homes, Land Securities . He also holds IG Group, National Grid, Shell (took some profits recently), BP. (Tom Pfeiffer) **** TELECOMS FACE REGULATORY TECTONIC SHIFT AS FANGS TARGETED (1143 GMT) HSBC has taken a look at the interface of telecoms and technology regulation and for once there's good news for phone companies, which have been the top underperformers in Europe over the last few years whereas tech has done brightly. \"After years of being on the receiving end of onerous rules imposed at the behest of Silicon Valley (i.e., net neutrality), there is now a tectonic shift underway for telecoms. The FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) have fallen from grace, and telecoms operators are looking to capitalise on this,\" HSBC analysts led by Stephen Howard say in a note. \"We very much doubt operators can seize the role of ‘innovation dynamo’ from the technology giants, and even net neutrality regulation is secure for the present (at least in Europe). However, one advantage of the new climate is that regulators now have, in the form of the FANGs, a fresh set of targets with a far higher media profile than that of the stolid telecoms operators,\" they add. Arguably any regulatory benefit may take time to materialise, but some investors are starting to consider the shifting regulatory environment as they look for fresh long-term opportunities. As you can see in the chart telecoms have led sectoral underperformers in Europe over the last 3 years, while tech has led the gainers. (Danilo Masoni) INSURANCE SECTOR REACHES A \"CRITICAL JUNCTURE\" (1126 GMT) Among the positivity on cyclicals (though not on a day like today), this is the positive view on Europe's insurance sector from Jefferies analysts. They estimate that the value of the sector gains 6 percent for a 50bps upward move in yields. Jefferies adds that an increase in yields benefits the primary life sector most. \"The primary conglomerates remain highly investible, in our view, with our investment focus on those companies continuing to refine capital allocation,\" Jefferies analysts say in a note. However, they do add that, in the event of a 10 percent equity market sell-off, reinsurance and non-life biased stocks such as Allianz and Zurich are the most defensive under such a scenario. (Kit Rees) MORE INVESTORS LOOK AT DIALLING DOWN RISK (1054 GMT) PIMCO’s European global wealth management team say they've found some of their financial intermediary clients in Europe have been looking at reducing risk in their portfolios. This has proven tricky in an environment of zero or negative real returns on cash, PIMCO adds. But they have two potential solutions: low volatility absolute return strategies and core bond strategies, especially those with a U.S. focus. \"Increasing core bond exposure is the more contrarian view; many clients say they plan to decrease allocations in the coming year,\" Ryan P. Blute, managing director and head of PIMCO’s global wealth management business in EMEA, says in a note. \"However, core bonds can play an important diversification role in a portfolio, and U.S. Treasuries in particular remain a source of high quality duration, historically outperforming when there are significant declines in equity or credit markets.\" (Kit Rees) TECH OUTPERFORMS, BUT APPLE AND SUPPLIERS REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE(1038 GMT) While tech is outperforming the market today in a recovery from yesterday's jitters, Frankfurt-listed shares in Apple are falling 1.6 percent to hit their lowest in three months. The bearish sentiment from that Nikkei report we mentioned earlier still seems to be taking its toll, and it's interesting to note that iPhone suppliers Dialog Semiconductor, AMS and ASMI are among the worst-performing in the sector. (Helen Reid) IS A CORRECTION ON THE CARDS? (0845 GMT) A negative day like today lays bare investor concerns about a more potent pullback in equity markets. \"Given current complacency and positioning, when things go wrong there may be quite a violent market reaction and I think we are moving more into that territory in 2018,\" Nicholas Brooks, head of research and investment strategy at Intermediate Capital Group, said, adding that he thinks we are due a correction. Brooks recommends moving into lower-beta sectors and companies and seeking out businesses with high cash flows in relatively defensive sectors. (Kit Rees and Tom Pfeiffer) OPENING SNAPSHOT: CYCLICAL SLIDE PULLS EUROPEAN SHARES LOWER (0817 GMT) European shares have opened lower thanks to falls among commodities-related sectors and financials - almost all sectors are in the red. Is this the start of a pullback? But elsewhere it's all about earnings, with a sprinkling of M&A. Alfa Laval and Swatch are the biggest risers after their updates, while UBM is also up there after Informa confirmed its deal with the conference organiser. Here's your opening snapshot: (Kit Rees) WHAT'S ON THE RADAR FOR EUROPEAN STOCKS (0750 GMT) Taking its cue from Wall Street and Asia, Europe’s stock market is set to suffer losses with futures down 0.6 to 0.8 percent across the major benchmarks. A slide in Apple shares was the catalyst for the weaker U.S. session, after a Nikkei report said the tech giant would halve its iPhone X production. The report came out during European trading hours on Monday and weighed on iPhone suppliers including AMS, Dialog Semiconductor and STMicro, but there may be further pressure on the chipmakers and tech stocks in this session as investors grow skittish about high valuations and the equity ‘melt-up’ with the MSCI World entering its longest ever period without a correction of more than 5 percent. Mining stocks could also be a weight, indicated lower in pre-market as base metals lose ground with the strengthening dollar. Under the benchmark level, a slew of company results should keep traders busy today.

After a strong earnings comeback last year, all eyes are on Europe to see if it can keep up the momentum.\n\nSo, what’s driving the pressure on European stocks right now? Investors are hopeful that top-line growth will return, which could boost operating profits. This optimism is supported by the fact that European stock valuations remain about 30 percent cheaper than those in the U.S., making the region an attractive option for many. However, this also means expectations are high, and any sign of slowing earnings could lead investors to pull back.\n\nBut it’s not just earnings that are shaping the market mood. We’ve seen a recent dip in the STOXX 600 index, marking its worst day in six weeks. Banks and miners have been hit hardest, as concerns over rising bond yields and global trade tensions create a cautious atmosphere. Meanwhile, volatility measures for U.S. stocks have ticked up, signaling increased nervousness among investors.\n\nIn this environment, some fund managers are looking for safer havens. Switzerland’s SMI index is gaining attention as a potential hedge. Unlike Japan’s Nikkei, which closely follows its currency movements, the Swiss market has shown more stability even when risk-off sentiment rises. This makes it an appealing option for those wanting to balance risk.\n\nOn a brighter note, fears about the eurozone breaking apart have eased significantly. Investor confidence is at an all-time high, with only a small fraction expecting any breakup within the next year. Italy remains a point of concern ahead of upcoming elections, but overall, the eurozone looks more robust than it has in years.\n\nAnother interesting dynamic is the shift between growth and value stocks. With bond yields climbing, investors might favor value stocks offering immediate returns over growth stocks promising future profits—unless those yield increases are driven by inflation risks rather than solid economic growth.\n\nTelecom companies in Europe are also entering a new phase. After years of regulatory pressure largely influenced by big tech firms like Facebook and Google, telecoms may now benefit from a changing regulatory landscape as attention shifts to those tech giants.\n\nFinally, some sectors like insurance could see gains if bond yields continue rising since they tend to benefit from higher interest rates. Yet, with market jitters growing, many investors are dialing down risk and exploring strategies like low volatility funds or increasing exposure to core bonds for diversification.\n\nTo sum up, European equities face a complex mix of opportunities and challenges in 2018. Strong earnings growth is expected but not guaranteed; market volatility is creeping up; and investors are actively seeking ways to balance risk with potential reward. Keeping an eye on these developments will be key as the year unfolds.\n\nThanks for listening—stay tuned for more insights on how global markets are evolving."}]}

Suncor’s share of the project will be 53.06 percent, compared to 20.89 percent for Teck and 26.05 percent for Total. \nFort Hills in northern Alberta produced 6,000 barrels per day during fourth-quarter test runs and is expected to fully start production in mid-January when the first of three secondary extraction trains starts up, Suncor said in a statement after markets closed. \nFort Hills’ startup comes as increasing oil sands supply outpaces Canadian pipeline capacity, creating a deepening price discount for Western Canada Select compared to benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI). ($1 = 1.2538 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Nia Williams in Calgary, Alberta; Editing by James Dalgleish)\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about a significant development in Canada’s oil sands industry involving some major players: Suncor Energy, Teck Resources, and Total.\n\nWe’ll explore how Suncor and Teck recently increased their stakes in the Fort Hills oil sands mine, what that means for the project’s future, and why this move matters in the broader context of Canadian oil production.\n\nHere’s the story. Fort Hills is a massive oil sands mine located in northern Alberta. It’s a big project, with a capital cost of about 17 billion Canadian dollars—roughly 13.5 billion US dollars. Initially, the ownership was divided among three partners: Suncor, Total, and Teck. But there was a dispute over the costs involved in building the mine.\n\nTo resolve this, Suncor and Teck agreed to take on larger shares of the project by contributing more funds—Suncor pitched in an extra 300 million Canadian dollars, and Teck added 120 million. This increased their ownership stakes to just over 53 percent for Suncor and nearly 21 percent for Teck. Total’s share decreased to about 26 percent.\n\nProduction at Fort Hills has already begun on a test basis, with around 6,000 barrels per day produced in the last quarter of the previous year. Full production is expected to ramp up soon, particularly when the first of three secondary extraction trains starts mid-January.\n\nThis development is noteworthy because it comes at a time when oil sands production is growing faster than pipeline capacity can handle. That imbalance is causing a discount on Canadian crude prices compared to US benchmarks like West Texas Intermediate.\n\nSo, to sum up: Suncor and Teck have taken on bigger roles at Fort Hills by investing more capital, helping move this massive project forward just as production is beginning to scale up. This shift not only settles previous disagreements but also reflects the challenges and dynamics shaping Canada’s oil sands sector today."}]}

That prompted 2,000 lawyers to march in protest against what they said was the most blatant interference in the city’s judicial independence.\nIncoming Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng, 59, said her “prime mission” would be to uphold the rule of law and that she would pursue criminal prosecutions “without any interference”.\nReporting by Venus Wu and Wyman Ma; Editing by James Pomfret, Greg Torode and Nick Macfie\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re looking at a significant change in Hong Kong’s legal leadership and what it means for the city’s rule of law. \n\nHong Kong’s independent legal system is a cornerstone of the “one country, two systems” arrangement established when Britain handed the city back to China in 1997. This system promises freedoms that are not found on the mainland. But in recent years, this independence has faced serious challenges.\n\nRecently, Hong Kong’s Justice Secretary, Rimsky Yuen, stepped down unexpectedly, more than four years before his term was due to end. He had just begun his second five-year term. The city’s leader, Carrie Lam, described him as a strong supporter of the rule of law. Yet, Yuen’s tenure was far from smooth.\n\nHe was involved in several controversies. For example, he played a key role in promoting a political reform package in 2014 that sparked the Umbrella Movement protests. These protests demanded full democracy but ultimately failed to achieve it. Yuen also faced backlash after reports emerged that he had overridden senior prosecutors to seek jail sentences for prominent pro-democracy activists like Joshua Wong.\n\nAnother contentious issue was an immigration arrangement allowing mainland Chinese officials to enforce mainland laws inside Hong Kong’s new high-speed railway station. This move effectively treated parts of the station as mainland territory, sidestepping Hong Kong’s Basic Law, which usually blocks national laws from applying locally. This sparked criticism from legal professionals who saw it as a serious step backward.\n\nDespite these tensions, Yuen maintained that all decisions were made according to the law, even if some disagreed with them. Notably, he reportedly tried to prevent Beijing from interfering in a court case against pro-independence lawmakers last year. He believed cases should be handled within Hong Kong’s own legal system whenever possible.\n\nHowever, Beijing’s parliament stepped in with its own interpretation of the law, blocking those lawmakers from their positions and provoking protests by thousands of lawyers who saw this as blatant interference in judicial independence.\n\nLooking ahead, Teresa Cheng is set to take over as Justice Secretary.

Through the first three months of the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the deficit was about 7% wider than it was the same period a year earlier, the Treasury said.\n...  \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s update on the federal budget. Let’s take a quick look at how things shaped up in December and what it means for the broader fiscal picture.\n\nThe big news is that the federal budget deficit in December got a little smaller compared to the same month last year. That’s mainly because government spending stayed about the same, while tax revenues went up. So, even though the government still spent more than it brought in, the gap was narrower.\n\nSpecifically, in December, the government’s spending exceeded its revenue by 23 billion dollars. To put that in context, this is an improvement from December of the previous year, when the deficit was 27 billion dollars. So, that’s a positive sign that things are moving in the right direction for that month.\n\nBut when we zoom out to look at the first three months of the fiscal year—which started on October 1—the picture changes a bit. Over this period, the deficit actually grew by about 7 percent compared to the same stretch a year earlier. So while December showed some progress, the overall trend for the start of the fiscal year points to a wider budget gap.\n\nIn summary, December’s federal deficit narrowed thanks to steady spending and higher tax receipts, but over the first quarter of the fiscal year, the deficit has increased compared to last year. It’s a mixed snapshot that highlights how monthly and longer-term budget trends can tell different stories.\n\nThat’s all for today’s budget update. Thanks for listening."}]}

This will give you a clear snapshot of how the company is doing financially.\n\nStarting with earnings per share, United Bancorp reported diluted earnings of 75 cents for 2017. That’s a modest increase of about 5.6% compared to 71 cents in 2016. So, the company showed some growth year over year, which is always a positive sign.\n\nLooking at the quarterly numbers, the bank’s net interest income after accounting for loan loss provisions came in at 4.1 million dollars. That’s up from 3.8 million dollars in the same quarter last year, indicating a slight improvement in core banking operations.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that in the fourth quarter and for the entire year ending December 31st, United Bancorp recorded a one-time write-down of four cents per share. This was related to changes brought about by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which affected how certain tax assets were valued on their books.\n\nFinally, for investors interested in dividends, United Bancorp offers a forward dividend yield of about 3.62 percent for the year. This suggests a steady return alongside their earnings performance.\n\nTo sum up, United Bancorp showed steady growth in earnings and interest income in 2017, despite some accounting adjustments due to new tax laws. Their dividend yield remains attractive, reflecting a stable position for shareholders.\n\nThat’s a concise look at United Bancorp’s recent financial results and what they mean going forward."}]}

This drug is being tested as a preventive treatment—what’s called prophylaxis—for people with Hemophilia A or B who have developed inhibitors. Inhibitors are antibodies that make standard treatments less effective, so finding new options is crucial.\n\nThe trial aims to evaluate how well MarzAA works and how safe it is for these patients.

This topic continues to be central to peace and security in the region and beyond.\n\nThe president of South Korea recently reaffirmed that denuclearization remains the country's basic stance. In other words, the commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula is foundational to South Korea’s policy and diplomatic efforts. This position reflects ongoing concerns about nuclear weapons and the desire for stability in Northeast Asia.\n\nTo break it down, denuclearization here means eliminating nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula, which has long been a goal for South Korea and its allies. By emphasizing that this is their basic stance, the president is making it clear that South Korea prioritizes diplomatic solutions aimed at reducing nuclear threats rather than accepting them as permanent.\n\nThis approach influences South Korea’s interactions with neighboring countries and international partners, guiding negotiations and security strategies. It also signals a continued push for dialogue and cooperation to achieve lasting peace.\n\nIn summary, the South Korean president’s recent statement serves as a reminder that denuclearization is not just a political talking point but a core principle shaping the country’s approach to regional security. It underscores a commitment to working toward a safer, nuclear-free future on the Korean Peninsula."}]}

This conversation has gained real momentum, and it’s not just about raising awareness anymore. The focus now is on creating tangible change, particularly when it comes to women advancing into leadership roles.\n\nSo, what’s happening at the top levels of business? At major global forums like Davos, advocates are pushing for discussions that don’t just stay theoretical. They want these talks to translate into real progress—meaning more women moving up the corporate ladder into senior positions where decisions are made.\n\nThis shift matters because it highlights a new expectation for companies. It’s no longer enough to acknowledge gender inequality; there’s a growing demand for action that leads to measurable results. The goal is clear: to create workplaces where leadership reflects true gender balance.\n\nIn summary, the push for gender equality in business is evolving. Thanks to movements like #MeToo, there’s a stronger call for meaningful change, especially at the highest levels of corporate power. The hope is that conversations at influential gatherings will spark real steps toward equal representation in leadership roles."}]}

Boxes containing aid from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) are seen ahead of their transfer to the Gaza Strip, inside the Kerem Shalom border crossing terminal between Israel and Gaza Strip January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Amir Cohen \nWhile saying the decision would sustain schools and health services, the U.S. official echoed U.S. President Donald Trump in calling on other nations to provide more funds because he believes the United States pays more than its share. \nThe decision to keep back some money is likely to compound the difficulty of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and to further undermine Arabs’ faith that the United States can act as an impartial arbitrator, particularly following Trump’s Dec. 6 announcement reversing decades of U.S. policy and recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. \nA Palestinian official quickly criticized Washington’s decision to keep back some of the money and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was unaware of any change on aid but he was “very concerned” about the possibility of a cut in funding. \nThe U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) that will receive the money needed to be fundamentally reevaluated “in the way it operates and the way it is funded.” \n“Without the funds we are providing today, UNRWA operations were at risk of running out of funds and closing down. The funds provided by the United States will prevent that from happening for the immediate future,” the official said, saying the additional “$65 million will be held for future consideration.” \nIn a Twitter post on Jan. 2, Trump said that Washington gives the Palestinians ”HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. \n“They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?” Trump added in his tweet. \nWhile the U.S. official did not link the U.S. decision to Trump’s tweet, he made a point often advanced by the president by saying the United States had been UNRWA’s single largest donor for decades and demanded other nations do more. \n“It is time other countries, some of them quite wealthy, step in and do their part to advance regional security and stability,” the official said. \nTrump’s aides initially debated whether to cut off all UNRWA aid after the tweet, a second U.S. official said. But those opposed to the idea argued that it could further destabilize the region, the official said. \n“This decision confirms the U.S administration is continuing in wiping out the rights of the Palestinian people,” Palestine Liberation Organization official Wasel Abu Youssef told Reuters. \n“First was declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and today the refugee issue,” he said. \nHistorically, U.S. administrations had said the status of Jerusalem must be decided in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The city is holy to three major monotheistic faiths. \nAt the United Nations, Guterres told reporters that the services provided by UNRWA were “of extreme importance, not only for the wellbeing of these populations ... but also in my opinion and an opinion that is shared by most international observers, including some Israeli ones, it is an important factor of stability.” \n“So if UNRWA will not be in a position to provide the vital services and the emergency forms of support that UNRWA has been providing this will create a very, very serious problem and we will do everything we can to avoid this situation,” he said.

At the same time, it is withholding another $65 million for now. This move comes amid calls from the U.S. government for other countries to contribute more, as they believe the U.S. has been shouldering a disproportionate share of the funding for decades.\n\nSo, what’s going on here? The aid that is being provided is meant to keep essential services running—things like schools and healthcare that many Palestinians rely on daily. But the decision to withhold part of the funding adds uncertainty and raises concerns about the future of UNRWA’s operations. A U.S. official emphasized that without this immediate funding, UNRWA risked running out of money and shutting down. However, they also stressed that the agency needs a fundamental reevaluation in how it operates and how it’s funded.\n\nThis decision has stirred criticism. Palestinian officials see it as part of a broader pattern that undermines Palestinian rights, especially following the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital late last year—a move that already shook confidence in America’s role as an impartial mediator. The United Nations Secretary-General expressed serious concern about any potential cuts, highlighting that UNRWA’s services are not just vital for Palestinian wellbeing but also important for regional stability.\n\nBehind these developments is a larger debate within the U.S. administration about how best to handle aid to Palestinians. Some initially considered cutting all funding, but others worried this could destabilize an already fragile situation.\n\nIn summary, while the U.S. is continuing to provide significant support to Palestinian refugees through UNRWA, its decision to hold back additional funds reflects ongoing tensions over funding responsibilities and political considerations. The future of this aid—and its impact on peace efforts and regional stability—remains uncertain, with many watching closely how other nations will respond to calls for greater involvement.\n\nThat’s the current state of U.S. aid to Palestinians and what it might mean moving forward."}]}

FILE PHOTO - Chinese banknotes are seen at a vendor's cash box at a market in Beijing February 14, 2014. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo \nNotching up their 11th straight month of gains, reserves rose $20.2 billion in December to $3.14 trillion, the highest since September 2016 and the biggest monthly increase since July, central bank data showed on Sunday. \nThat compares with an increase of $10 billion in November. \nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to rise by $6 billion to $3.125 trillion. \nCapital flight had been seen as a major risk for China at the start of 2017, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the economy. \nThe yuan rose around 6.8 percent against the greenback in 2017, recovering from a 6.5 percent loss in 2016 and reversing three straight years of depreciation. \nThe value of gold reserves rose to $76.47 billion at the end of December, from $75.833 billion at the end of November, data on the PBOC website also showed. Related Coverage\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome back to the show. Today, we're diving into some interesting developments in China’s foreign exchange reserves and what they reveal about the country’s economic outlook.\n\nSo, what’s been happening with China’s foreign exchange reserves? Well, as of December 2017, these reserves hit their highest level in over a year, reaching about 3.14 trillion dollars. This marked the 11th straight month of growth and was actually a bigger jump than many experts expected. To put it in perspective, reserves increased by roughly 20 billion dollars in December alone, which is double the increase seen in November.\n\nWhy is this important? For a while, there were concerns about capital flight from China—that is, money leaving the country—which can signal economic uncertainty. But tighter regulations on capital movement and a stronger Chinese yuan helped turn things around. In fact, the yuan rose about 6.8 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2017, bouncing back from losses in previous years and ending a three-year trend of depreciation.\n\nAlongside this, China’s gold reserves also saw a modest increase, going up from about 75.8 billion to 76.5 billion dollars by the end of December.\n\nAll of this suggests that confidence in China’s economy was strengthening at the end of 2017, supported by regulatory measures and currency stability.\n\nTo sum up, China’s growing foreign exchange reserves and a stronger yuan point to a more stable financial environment than many had feared just a year earlier. It’s a reminder of how policy and market factors can work together to influence economic confidence.\n\nThanks for tuning in today. We’ll keep an eye on how these trends continue to evolve. Until next time!"}]}

But recently, a key federal official made it clear where he stands on this idea.\n\nFederal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai publicly stated his opposition to the government building and operating a nationwide 5G network. In simple terms, he doesn’t support the federal government taking over this critical infrastructure. This stance adds some uncertainty to proposals that were being considered within parts of the Trump administration.\n\nTo understand why this matters, it helps to know a bit about how wireless service works in the U.S. Right now, four major companies—Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint—dominate the wireless market. These companies have built out the networks that most people rely on every day for their cellphones. As technology advances, each company is looking for ways to expand and improve their services, including rolling out 5G.\n\nThe idea of a government-run 5G network would be a big change from this private-sector model. But Chairman Pai’s statement signals a preference for keeping the development and operation of 5G networks in private hands rather than shifting control to the government.\n\nSo, to sum up: while some have suggested the federal government should take charge of building the nationwide 5G system, the FCC chairman firmly opposes that approach. The future of 5G in America looks set to continue with private companies leading the way.\n\nThat’s the latest on this important topic as we watch how our wireless networks evolve in the coming years."}]}

Bellus3D is already teaming up with developers to explore real-world applications. One area is virtual reality, where these 3D faces could bring avatars to life in a much more convincing way. In medicine, this tech could help visualize changes before plastic surgery, giving patients a clearer idea of potential results. And in shopping, imagine trying on clothes virtually—using your own 3D image to see how outfits fit before you even hit the store.\n\nRight now, the technology is available mainly to developers as they refine it. But production and delivery are expected to start soon, within the first few months of this year.\n\nIn short, Bellus3D’s facial scanning tech could change how we see ourselves and interact with digital worlds—from healthcare to fashion and beyond.

It’s a story about trust, protest, and the challenges of diplomacy in a complex war zone.\n\nHere’s what happened: The head of the Syrian opposition delegation decided to boycott the conference. Why? Because promises made to protect civilians from bombardment hadn’t been kept. On top of that, there were issues with the removal of Syrian state emblems from the meeting venue—something the opposition saw as important for maintaining neutrality and respect.\n\nAhmed Tomah, who leads the opposition group, explained this decision in a video message recorded at Sochi airport. Instead of attending, his group chose to return to Turkey in protest. He also mentioned that the Turkish delegation would carry their demands forward at the conference.\n\nSo, what does this mean? It highlights how fragile negotiations can be in conflict zones, especially when trust breaks down over issues like civilian safety and symbolism. The boycott sends a clear message that without concrete actions and respect for agreed terms, dialogue becomes difficult.\n\nTo sum up, this incident underscores the ongoing struggles within peace efforts for Syria. Promises on protecting civilians and respecting opposition concerns are crucial. Without them, even well-intentioned talks risk falling apart before they begin."}]}

There have been some exciting developments as teams secure their spots in the quarter-finals, and we’ll break down who’s through and what’s ahead.\n\nFirst up, French club La Rochelle made a strong statement by reaching the quarter-finals in their very first appearance. They secured a solid 16-7 win over England’s Harlequins, topping Pool 1 in the process. La Rochelle, currently second in France’s Top 14 league, will face the Scarlets next. The Scarlets are making waves too, becoming the first Welsh team in six years to reach this stage after a narrow 30-27 victory over Toulon.\n\nSpeaking of Toulon, they didn’t miss out entirely—they advanced as one of the best runners-up. However, their next challenge will be a tough one against Munster from Ireland. Munster dominated their pool with a commanding 48-3 win over Castres, finishing ahead of Racing 92.\n\nRacing 92 themselves will go up against another French side, Clermont Auvergne. Clermont topped Pool 2 after a strong 24-7 win over the Ospreys.\n\nAnd then there’s Saracens, the defending champions from England. Despite a huge 62-14 win against Northampton Saints, they had to wait anxiously to see if they’d make it through as one of the top three runners-up. Thankfully for them, they did. Their reward? A quarter-final clash with Leinster, who secured top seed status by beating Montpellier 23-14.\n\nSo looking ahead, we have some intriguing matchups: La Rochelle versus Scarlets; Toulon taking on Munster; Racing 92 facing Clermont Auvergne; and Saracens meeting Leinster. Each game promises high stakes and intense competition as these top European clubs battle for a spot in the semi-finals.\n\nTo sum up, this Champions Cup season is delivering surprises and fierce contests alike. Newcomers like La Rochelle are making their mark, while established powerhouses continue to fight hard for glory. It’s shaping up to be an exciting knockout phase that no rugby fan will want to miss."}]}

Today, we’re looking at an important update on the conflict in Syria, which has been ongoing for several years now. Specifically, we’ll hear what Hezbollah’s leader has recently said about how much longer the war might last and some key developments involving the group.\n\nSo, here’s the context: The Syrian war started back in 2011 and has dragged on for seven years. It’s been a complex and devastating conflict with many players involved. One major group supporting Syria’s government is Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based organization backed by Iran.\n\nRecently, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, spoke in an interview with a Lebanese TV channel that’s close to Iran. He expressed confidence that the Syrian war will come to an end within one or two years at most. This is a significant statement given how long the conflict has already lasted.\n\nNasrallah also addressed concerns about Israeli military actions targeting Hezbollah positions inside Syria. He said these strikes have not stopped—and will not stop—Hezbollah from receiving weapons supplies. This suggests that despite outside efforts to disrupt their support lines, Hezbollah remains well-armed and active in the region.\n\nTo sum up, Hezbollah’s leader sees the Syrian war winding down soon and insists that external attacks haven’t hindered their ability to get arms. This perspective offers insight into how some key players view the ongoing conflict and its possible timeline.\n\nThat’s all for today’s update on the Syrian war and Hezbollah’s role in it.

President Nicolas Maduro suspended DICOM in responses to financial sanctions by Washington. \nVenezuela’s exchange controls provide dollars at the official rate of 10 bolivars for import of priority goods such as food and medicine. The black market rate is currently 263,803 per dollar, according to web-site DolarToday, which is the most widely-used reference. \nThe central bank did not say what the new DICOM exchange rate would be. A Powerpoint presentation about DICOM says buyers will “pay the price they proposed.” \nBefore the auctions were halted, DICOM was selling dollars at 3,345 bolivars. Though the DICOM rate has been consistently more favorable than the black market, businesses generally say it is of little use because it sells limited volumes, meaning it does not provide a steady supply of hard currency for imports. (Reporting by Corina Pons; Writing by Brian Ellsworth; Editing by Susan Thomas)\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into a significant development in Venezuela’s ongoing economic crisis—specifically, how the government is trying to change the way people and businesses access foreign currency.\n\nVenezuela has been struggling with hyperinflation and severe shortages, problems that many experts link to strict currency controls in place for about 15 years. These controls limit access to foreign currency, especially the US dollar, which is crucial for importing goods. Now, the government is introducing a new legal mechanism aimed at easing this pressure.\n\nHere’s what’s happening: the Central Bank of Venezuela announced that securities denominated in hard currency—that is, dollars or euros—will be allowed to trade on a local stock exchange called the Bicentenary Exchange. This means private companies can issue debt in foreign currency and sell it locally. For citizens and businesses, this creates a legal way to obtain dollars without relying on the black market, where prices are sky-high and transactions are technically illegal.\n\nTo put it in context, between 2004 and 2010, Venezuela had a similar system called “permuta,” which acted as a parallel foreign exchange market. That system was shut down by the late President Hugo Chavez because it was blamed for encouraging speculation and harming the economy. Now, this new move reopens that market but under official regulation.\n\nIn addition to this, the government plans to restart its DICOM auction system, which sells euros and dollars at rates set by buyers’ offers. DICOM had been suspended last year due to U.S. financial sanctions. Before it stopped, DICOM sold dollars at around 3,345 bolivars each—a rate much better than the black market’s staggering 263,803 bolivars per dollar. However, DICOM’s auctions were criticized because they offered limited volumes, so businesses couldn’t rely on it for steady access to foreign currency.\n\nDespite these efforts, experts are skeptical about how much these changes will help because the local currency has lost more than 99 percent of its value on the black market. That makes it incredibly difficult for businesses to afford imported goods even if they can access dollars legally.\n\nSo, while Venezuela’s reopening of hard-currency securities trading and restarting of currency auctions represent an attempt to create more legal pathways for foreign exchange, the underlying economic challenges remain daunting.\n\nIn summary, Venezuela is trying to loosen its tight grip on foreign currency by allowing dollar-denominated securities to trade locally and reviving auction systems for euros and dollars. These steps could help businesses import needed goods more easily but may not be enough to resolve the deeper issues caused by hyperinflation and a collapsing local currency."}]}

Specifically, we'll focus on an incident in the Turkish border town of Kilis and the broader context surrounding it.\n\nOn a recent Wednesday, two rockets were fired from the Syrian region of Afrin and struck Kilis, a town right on the border with Syria. These rockets hit two locations in the city center, one of which was a mosque during prayer times. The timing made the attack especially concerning, as people were gathered for worship. In total, 13 people were wounded—eight at the mosque, including two in critical condition, and five at the other site.\n\nFollowing the attacks, Turkish security forces quickly moved to clear civilians from the affected areas. Ambulances and emergency teams arrived promptly to provide medical assistance to those injured.\n\nThis incident is part of a larger pattern linked to Turkey’s ongoing military operation against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin. By this point, the operation had been underway for five days. During this time, several rockets have landed in Turkish border towns like Kilis and Reyhanli. For example, on the first day of the operation, rockets fired across the border struck Reyhanli, resulting in one death—a Syrian national—and injuring 46 others. Kilis also saw injuries from rocket fire at that time.\n\nThese events highlight how conflicts in neighboring regions can quickly affect civilian populations across borders, creating a complex and dangerous situation for those living nearby.\n\nTo sum up, recent rocket attacks from Afrin have caused significant harm in Turkish border towns, especially Kilis, where civilians—including worshippers—were wounded. This is part of ongoing hostilities connected to Turkey’s military actions against Kurdish forces in Syria. It’s a stark reminder of how regional conflicts can have immediate and serious impacts on everyday people just across a border."}]}

McMaster that Washington would not provide the YPG with weapons anymore. Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Mark Potter\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re looking at a tense situation unfolding in northern Syria, where Turkey is calling on the United States to pull its forces out of the Manbij region immediately. This area has become a flashpoint in the complex dynamics of the Syrian conflict.\n\nSo, what’s happening here? Turkey’s Foreign Minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, made it clear that the U.S. presence in Manbij is no longer acceptable from Ankara’s perspective. This comes right after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced plans for Turkish forces to remove Kurdish fighters from along the Syrian border. Erdogan even suggested that this operation could extend all the way east to the border with Iraq, including Manbij itself.\n\nThis is significant because U.S. troops are currently allied with Kurdish fighters in the region, specifically the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia. Turkey views the YPG as a terrorist group and wants to see an end to American support for them. Cavusoglu emphasized that Turkey expects concrete steps from the U.S. to stop backing the YPG.\n\nEarlier reports indicated that the U.S. National Security Adviser had assured Turkey that Washington would cease supplying weapons to the YPG. Despite this, tensions remain high as Turkey prepares for potential military operations that could bring it into direct confrontation with U.S. forces.\n\nIn summary, Turkey is pressing for an immediate U.S. withdrawal from Manbij and an end to American support for Kurdish militias there. This situation highlights the delicate balance of alliances and conflicts in northern Syria and raises questions about how these competing interests will be managed moving forward."}]}

Income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 included a $137,000 write-off of a deferred tax asset associated with the establishment of the Bank’s foundation in 2011.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016\nNet interest income\nNet interest income increased $9.2 million or 13% to $80.4 million for the year ended 2017 compared to $71.3 million for the year ended 2016 primarily due to a $234.1 million increase in the average loans balance and an 11 basis point increase in the loans yield to 3.68% offset by a $2.3 million increase in interest expense. Net interest margin was 2.93% for the year ended 2017 compared to 2.80% for the year ended 2016. The total interest-earning assets yield increased 18 basis points to 3.57% for the year ended 2017 compared to 3.39% for the year ended 2016 primarily due to an increase in yield on our loan and securities portfolios. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 4 basis points to 82 basis points for the year ended 2017 compared to 78 basis points for the year ended 2016.\nProvision for loan losses\nProvision for loan losses was $1.6 million for the year ended 2017 compared to $2.3 million for the year ended 2016. Net charge-offs for the year ended 2017 were $632,000 or 0.02% to average loans compared to $1.0 million or 0.04% to average loans for the year ended 2016. The allowance for loan losses represented 0.82% of total loans at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.85% at December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest income\nTotal noninterest income increased $761,000 to $13.5 million for the year ended 2017 compared to $12.7 million for the year ended 2016. Fees for customer services increased $252,000 to $6.4 million for the year ended 2017 compared to the year ended 2016 driven by our growth in checking accounts and debit card fees. Net gain on loans sold decreased $508,000 to $2.6 million for the year ended 2017 compared to the year ended 2016 as a result of a decrease in volume of loans sold. Bank owned life insurance income increased $211,000 to $1.6 million for the year ended 2017 compared to the year ended 2016 primarily due to $194,000 more in bank owned life insurance proceeds in 2017 than in the prior year.

We’ll explore how the bank’s earnings, loan growth, and other key financial metrics shaped up, and what factors influenced these results.\n\nStarting with earnings, the company reported a net income of just under half a million dollars for the fourth quarter of 2017. That’s a noticeable drop from over four million dollars in the same period a year earlier. But when you exclude one-time items, their core net income actually rose by 32 percent compared to the previous year’s quarter. For the full year, net income was $16.2 million, slightly higher than the prior year’s $15.2 million. Core net income for 2017 was even stronger at nearly $21 million, up significantly from $14.8 million in 2016.\n\nA major factor affecting the fourth quarter was the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the federal tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent starting in 2018. This change led to a one-time tax expense of $5 million in late 2017 due to adjustments in deferred tax assets. However, this tax cut is expected to boost earnings per share by around 24 to 25 cents in 2018.\n\nLooking at loan growth, Farmington Bank saw strong organic increases. Loans grew by nearly $50 million in the last quarter alone, driven mainly by commercial and residential real estate loans. Over the year, total loans increased by about 8 percent. Deposits also rose by 10 percent compared to the previous year, reaching $2.4 billion at year-end. The ratio of loans to deposits held steady at around 113 percent.\n\nIn terms of income sources, net interest income—a key revenue stream—rose by 13 percent compared to the prior year’s fourth quarter, thanks to higher loan balances and improved yields on loans. The net interest margin was just under 3 percent for the quarter. Noninterest income saw some fluctuations due to lower gains on loan sales but was partly offset by increases in fees related to mortgage banking derivatives and customer services.\n\nExpenses were well-managed, with a slight decrease in noninterest expenses compared to the previous quarter and only a modest increase over the prior year’s fourth quarter due mainly to salary increases.\n\nAsset quality remained strong throughout the period. Delinquent loans stayed low at around 0.6 percent of total loans, and non-accrual loans were similarly stable. The allowance for loan losses stayed consistent at about 0.82 percent of total loans.\n\nTo sum up, First Connecticut Bancorp delivered solid core earnings growth in 2017 despite some one-time tax-related expenses late in the year. The bank showed healthy loan and deposit growth, maintained strong asset quality, and continued improving operational efficiency. Looking ahead, the recent tax law changes are expected to positively impact future earnings, supporting continued growth and shareholder returns.\n\nThat wraps up our overview of Farmington Bank’s financial performance through 2017—a story of steady progress and resilience amid changing economic conditions."}]}

Haruhiko Kuroda undercut speculation that the central bank was close to ending its postcrisis stimulus policies.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 2.622%, compared with 2.663% Monday, logging its first decline after four sessions of increases. Yields fall when bond prices rise.\nFollowing the BOJ’s latest policy meeting, Mr. Kuroda said the central bank wasn’t ready to even discuss an exit to its monetary stimulus, given that inflation was still less than halfway to the bank’s target.\nThat message helped bolster government bonds across developed markets, sending a cautionary signal to investors that major central banks could take their time in shifting to tighter monetary policies despite an improved global-growth outlook.\nInvestors and analysts widely agree that bond-buying programs by the BOJ and European Central Bank have played a large role in dragging down yields globally. The purchases have made bonds in those regions more scarce and driven yield-starved investors to buy U.S. fixed-income assets.\nInvestors have speculated recently that better economic data would allow both the BOJ and ECB to stop adding to their bond portfolios, contributing to a large increase in Treasury yields.\nAfter finishing 2017 at 2.409%, the 10-year Treasury yield moved above 2.6% last week and settled Monday at its highest level since April 2014.\nStoking the speculation about central banks, minutes from the ECB’s December meeting revealed officials “widely” agreed that the bank needed to change its guidance to investors early this year to better reflect the state of the eurozone economy. Earlier this month, the BOJ also bought fewer long-term Japanese government bonds than investors had expected, a move that added to market jitters even as some analysts dismissed it as unimportant.\nMany investors and analysts expect the Treasurys market to remain under pressure in the coming months, as long as the economy stays on its current trajectory.\n“In general we think over the next couple of months yields should across the curve grind higher,” said John Herrmann, rates strategist at MUFG Securities in New York. One possibility, he said, is that the Federal Reserve could raise its forecasts for economic growth and inflation, causing a big jump in long-term Treasury yields.\nThough consumer prices have been rising slowly, many investors expect falling unemployment to eventually lead to higher inflation, which is a main threat to government bonds because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed payments and can make it easier for the Fed to raise interest rates.\nWrite to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about what’s been happening with U.S. government bonds and why recent comments from the Bank of Japan have made a difference.\n\nRecently, U.S. Treasury yields, especially on the 10-year note, had been rising steadily. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions, so rising yields mean bond prices were falling. This trend caught many investors’ attention because it suggested expectations of tighter monetary policies ahead. But then, something shifted.\n\nBank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stepped in with a clear message after his central bank’s latest meeting: they are not ready to even talk about ending their long-standing stimulus measures. Inflation in Japan is still well below their target, so they plan to keep supporting the economy for now. This stance surprised some investors who had been speculating that the Bank of Japan might soon scale back its bond-buying programs.\n\nWhy does this matter for U.S. bonds? Well, both the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank have been major players in buying government bonds to keep yields low in their regions. Their purchases reduce the supply of bonds available to investors, pushing these investors toward U.S. Treasury securities. When there’s uncertainty about whether these banks will slow down their buying, it can cause bond yields around the world to move.\n\nAfter Kuroda’s comments, U.S. Treasury yields actually dropped slightly, marking their first decline after several days of increases. This suggests investors are now thinking that central banks might take more time before tightening policies, even though global economic growth looks stronger than before.\n\nLooking ahead, many analysts believe Treasury yields could still rise gradually if the economy keeps improving. Falling unemployment might eventually push inflation higher, which tends to reduce bond prices because inflation erodes the value of fixed payments from bonds. And if inflation picks up, the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates more aggressively.\n\nSo, while recent signals from Japan have calmed markets a bit, the overall picture remains one where investors are watching economic data closely and preparing for possible shifts in monetary policy.\n\nIn short, central banks’ actions and signals continue to play a key role in shaping U.S. Treasury yields. For now, patience seems to be the word as these institutions weigh their next moves carefully amid evolving economic conditions."}]}

Specifically, the acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Company, a well-known name in nuclear services.\n\nHere’s what’s happening: Brookfield Business Partners, along with a group of investors, announced they’re buying Westinghouse from Toshiba for around 4.6 billion dollars. This deal comes after Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy earlier in the year.\n\nTo give you some background, Westinghouse ran into serious financial trouble because two nuclear power plants it was building in the southeastern United States ended up costing way more than expected—billions over their original contracts. That financial strain led to the bankruptcy filing back in March.\n\nNow, with this acquisition by Brookfield and its partners, there’s a plan to move forward under new ownership. The deal is expected to be finalized sometime in the third quarter of 2018.\n\nIn short, this purchase marks a significant step for Brookfield as it takes over a company that has faced big challenges but remains an important player in nuclear energy. It will be interesting to see how Westinghouse evolves from here under new leadership."}]}

The gains in financials added 37 points to the FTSE. \n“When there’s movement in the bond yields, the UK banks do benefit from that in a number of ways. Firstly, they make higher revenues in terms of their returns,” John Moore, trader at Berkeley Capital, said. \n“We think UK banks could do quite well despite the uncertainty, purely because we see them as undervalued.” \nRoyal Bank of Scotland led the FTSE 100, up 4.6 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on the stock to “overweight”. \nMorgan Stanley said RBS was the most resilient UK bank in an uncertain outlook. \nRBS peers HSBC and Standard Chartered also gained 3.7 and 3.3 percent as banks across the region rallied, with the pan-European banks index at a two-year high thanks to rising bond yields. \nWednesday was another day dominated by Christmas updates from retailers, with shares in grocer Sainsbury’s advancing 1.9 percent after it beat forecasts slightly in its Christmas trading update. \n“Sainsbury’s has delivered reassuring trading through what, post the Argos acquisition, is its key quarter for sales and profitability,” analysts at UBS said in a note. \nThis continued a positive theme for food retailers over the festive period as shoppers resisted cutting back on food purchases despite inflationary pressures on the consumer. \nPeer Morrisons enjoyed a rally in the previous session after its own update. \nSainsbury’s however cautioned the market for general merchandise and clothing would be tough in 2018, and mixed results from non-food retailers on Wednesday reflected this difficult environment. \nTed Baker shares jumped 9.7 percent to lead the mid-cap index, thanks to a surge in online purchases for the fashion retailer, helping Christmas sales. \nOther clothing retailers fared considerably less well, with small-cap Moss Brothers tumbling 16 percent and Superdry down 9.3 percent at the bottom of the FTSE 250. \nLiberum analysts said the weakest retail segments have been electronics, clothing and fashion. \nHousebuilder Taylor Wimpey found itself at the bottom of the FTSE 100, however, down 4.2 percent on the back of a trading statement. \nThe housebuilder said its full-year results for 2017 would be in line with expectations. \nElsewhere a warning from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) put pressure on shares in spreadbetters, with IG Group dropping 4.4 percent, Plus500 down 5.5 percent and CMC Markets down 2.3 percent. \nThe FCA said its review of the industry found “areas of serious concern” in Britain’s contracts for differences (CFDs) market.

We’ll explore how banks and retailers performed, and what factors played into these moves.\n\nSo, on a recent Wednesday, the FTSE 100, which tracks Britain’s largest companies, hit a fresh closing record, rising by about 0.2 percent to nearly 7,750 points. This outpaced the broader European market, even though mid-sized companies actually saw a slight dip. The driving force behind this gain? A boost in bank and oil stocks.\n\nNow, why did banks rally? It turns out that rising bond yields played a key role. When bond yields go up, banks often benefit because they can earn higher returns on their lending activities. John Moore, a trader from Berkeley Capital, pointed out that despite uncertainties in the market, UK banks appear undervalued and could perform well. Royal Bank of Scotland led the charge with a strong 4.6 percent jump after Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on the bank, calling it the most resilient among UK banks given the uncertain outlook. Other big names like HSBC and Standard Chartered also saw gains of around 3 to 4 percent.\n\nShifting gears to retail, Christmas trading updates continued to influence stock prices. Sainsbury’s shares rose nearly 2 percent after reporting slightly better than expected holiday sales. This was encouraging news because it suggested shoppers didn’t cut back on food despite inflation pressures. However, Sainsbury’s did warn that sales in general merchandise and clothing might be challenging in 2018. This warning was reflected in mixed results across non-food retailers. Ted Baker stood out with a notable jump of nearly 10 percent thanks to strong online sales during the festive season. On the flip side, some clothing retailers like Moss Brothers and Superdry experienced significant declines.\n\nOutside of banks and retail, housebuilder Taylor Wimpey fell by over 4 percent after confirming its full-year results would meet expectations but didn’t exceed them. Meanwhile, shares in spreadbetting firms took a hit following a warning from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. The regulator expressed serious concerns about Britain’s contracts for differences market, leading to share price drops for companies like IG Group and Plus500.\n\nIn summary, the FTSE 100’s new record was largely fueled by rising bond yields boosting bank stocks and some positive retail news from the holiday season. Yet, challenges remain for certain sectors like clothing retail and spreadbetting firms under regulatory scrutiny. It’s a reminder of how varied forces can come together to shape market performance on any given day."}]}

Pemex won one block, and three blocks were not awarded because they received no bids.\nCompetition for the basin was expected to be fierce, but a consortium of Shell and Qatar Petroleum was the sole bidder on three blocks.\n“Mexico is the winner here,” said Alberto de la Fuente, president of Shell Mexico.\nShell would spend more than the minimum investment it pledged in the bids, he said, but declined to give further details.\nShell won a block in an earlier auction in Mexico’s shallow waters in 2017. The company also has a chain of 30 gas stations in Mexico, he said.\nThree other blocks were awarded in the auction.\nPC Carigali, a unit of Malaysia’s state oil firm Petronas, was part of three different consortia that won those blocks.\n“We’re excited,” said Faisal Bakar, Carigali’s country manager in Mexico. “We’re in, we want to explore and we want to find oil and gas.”\nCarigali also participated in winning bids for two deep water fields in an earlier auction.\nA Pemex logo is seen at the Energy Mexico Expo 2018 in Mexico City, Mexico January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso For a full list of winners and bidders, click here.\nOIL PRICE HELPS The world’s top energy firms have lobbied for decades for access to Mexico’s oil and gas reserves.\nState oil giant Pemex [PEMX.UL], whose 75-year monopoly over the energy sector ended under Mexico’s 2013 reform, lacked the cash and expertise to extract oil and gas from the rock below the country’s deepest waters.\nWith oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 near a three-year high, energy firms are emerging from a recession. They have more cash now than at any time since 2014, so conditions are better than they were for any of the eight auctions Mexico has held since 2015.\nThe higher oil price helped Shell to put in solid bids, de la Fuente said.\nShell was also a big winner in an oil auction for blocks in Brazil’s deepwater in October, snapping up three blocks in the presalt region in the country’s Atlantic waters.\nMexico faces stiff competition from Brazil and other regional rivals keen to attract cash from global oil majors. Argentina, Uruguay and Ecuador are also auctioning oil and gas fields this year.\nThe wide-ranging energy reform was Pena Nieto’s highest-profile economic initiative, aimed at attracting hundreds of billions of dollars of investment to turn around a state-run oil industry in decline. The results of previous auctions to attract foreign investment were mixed.\nFirms that won in the previous auctions have pledged investments of $61 billion. But Mexico needs 10 times that amount to raise oil output back to 2004 levels, the country’s Energy Secretary Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said on Tuesday.\nThe southeastern portion of the Salina basin should also see strong interest, oil executives and industry executives said. (Graphic on the blocks: tmsnrt.rs/2DGpgnB )\nSome of the firms that won in previous auctions have made big finds, adding over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to reserves.\nMexico is expected to hold its first shale oil and gas auction by the end of 2018, the head of the country’s oil regulator said on Wednesday, potentially opening up one of the world’s top reserves of unconventional energy.\nRelated Coverage Factbox: Companies who bid or won in Mexico's deep water oil sale Factbox: Mexican deepwater oil auction offers up potentially lucrative areas Additional reporting by Ana Isabel Martinez in Mexico City, Alexandra Alper in Rio de Janeiro, Nidhi Verma in New Delhi and Osamu Tsukimori in Tokyo; Writing by Simon Webb; Editing by Andrew Hay and Bernadette Baum\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s episode, where we’re diving into a major shift in Mexico’s energy landscape. Recently, Mexico held its biggest oil and gas auction since opening up the sector to international companies, and the results are already making waves.\n\nSo, what happened? Well, Royal Dutch Shell emerged as a clear leader, winning five out of the first eight deepwater blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. These blocks are in some of Mexico’s most prized offshore areas, especially the Perdido basin near U.S. waters where there’s existing infrastructure. Shell teamed up with Qatar Petroleum to secure four of these blocks, and in another partnership with Mexico’s own state oil company Pemex, they took home one more.\n\nPemex itself won just one block this time around, while three blocks went unawarded because no companies placed bids on them. Interestingly, although competition was expected to be fierce, Shell and Qatar Petroleum were actually the only bidders on three of the blocks they won.\n\nShell’s presence in Mexico isn’t new—they previously won a block in shallower waters back in 2017 and operate a chain of gas stations across the country. The company’s investment plans here are solid, though they’ve kept specific numbers under wraps.\n\nOther winners included Malaysia’s Petronas through its unit PC Carigali, which was part of three different consortia that secured blocks. Petronas is eager to explore and develop these new fields, building on their past successes in Mexico’s deep waters.\n\nNow, why is this auction such a big deal? For decades, Mexico’s oil sector was controlled solely by Pemex, but a major reform in 2013 ended that monopoly. Pemex struggled with both funding and expertise to tap into deepwater reserves. With global oil prices climbing near three-year highs, conditions are better than ever for international companies to invest. This has encouraged firms like Shell to place strong bids.\n\nMexico isn’t alone in courting global energy majors—Brazil and other South American countries like Argentina and Uruguay are also holding auctions to attract investment. For Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and his administration, these auctions are crucial for demonstrating progress before upcoming elections.\n\nDespite some promising discoveries adding billions of barrels to reserves, Mexico still faces a steep challenge. The country needs roughly ten times the investment pledged so far—about $61 billion—to return oil production to its 2004 peak. Looking ahead, Mexico plans to hold its first shale oil and gas auction soon, potentially unlocking vast unconventional resources.\n\nIn summary, this latest auction marks an important step for Mexico’s energy sector liberalization. Shell’s strong showing highlights renewed interest from major players, supported by rising oil prices and a more open market. Yet, significant investment and exploration lie ahead if Mexico hopes to fully revitalize its oil industry.\n\nThanks for listening—stay tuned for more updates on global energy developments next time."}]}

Remember when Gap was a defining brand in the ’90s? Well, they’re aiming to capture that same spirit again, but with a fresh twist.\n\nSo, what’s their approach? Gap is launching a new marketing campaign that’s tied to the Grammy Awards, which is a smart way to reach music lovers and pop culture fans alike. At the heart of this campaign is a brand-new song crafted by Metro Boomin, who’s known for shaping the modern sound of pop and hip-hop. Metro Boomin is a big name in music production right now, so his involvement signals Gap’s intention to be relevant and current.\n\nThe song itself is interesting because it puts a contemporary spin on an ’80s classic—the Thompson Twins’ hit “Hold Me Now.” This blend of nostalgic melody with modern beats aims to appeal both to those who remember the original and to a younger audience discovering it anew. The track will debut in the TV commercial during the Grammys and will also be released on streaming platforms shortly after.\n\nIn essence, Gap is using music as a bridge between past and present, hoping to reignite the kind of cultural connection that made it iconic decades ago. By partnering with Metro Boomin and tapping into a beloved ’80s tune, they’re crafting a campaign that’s both fresh and familiar.\n\nTo sum up, Gap’s new campaign combines classic vibes with contemporary sounds to recapture its place in today’s cultural conversation—using music as the key to unlock that connection once again."}]}

Offer returnees more support than their neighbors and it could spur others to leave for Europe.\nMany of the returned migrants are traumatized, illiterate, or live in remote areas - making them difficult to assist.\n“I know people who have ideas, but they don’t have any help,” said Donald Greywoode, 36, who quit his office job and set off for Europe on a route known locally as “the back way”.\nWhen Greywoode came back, he found himself collecting trash.\nWithout education, training or job opportunities, boredom and resentment could boil over into conflict, analysts said.\n“The stakes are very, very high,” said Franzisca Zanker, a researcher at Germany’s University of Freiburg, who has studied migration governance in Gambia.\nUNDETERRED Several returnees told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that they had not wanted to come home, but having been locked up, abused and starved in Libya, were left with no other choice.\n“We don’t see ourselves as voluntary returnees,” said Mustapha Sallah, 26, who came back from Libya in April.\n“They said if you don’t want to go home, you die here,” Sallah said. “Leaving was the only option.”\nCoupled with the lack of opportunity, such frustration could drive people to migrate once more, experts warned. Others said broader economic changes would be needed to keep youth at home.\n“Even after training all these people in all these skills, if the industry is not there, they will still struggle,” said Kebba Sillah, head of Sterling Consortium, a vocational training institute supported by the EU Trust Fund for Africa.\n“I think the EU needs to encourage their businesses to come set up here, not just pump in money,” Sillah added.\nWhile many returnees said they would never again attempt the treacherous journey through Libya, some still dream of Europe.\nJerreh Cham, 22, has received EU funding to complete a satellite installation course and attend business management school since returning from Libya in August.\nBut it is not enough to keep him at home.\n“My plan is to get my qualification before reaching Europe,” said Cham, sitting in the yard outside his family’s small home.\n“If I go with my qualification and everything, I don’t think anybody will discount me. I think they will give me my respect.”\nReporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Kieran Guilbert; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.

It’s about young people risking everything to leave, the harsh realities they face, and the struggle to build a future back home.\n\nLet’s start with Saikou Jammeh, a 24-year-old Gambian who persuaded his father to sell their family home to pay for his journey to Europe. Saikou saw no future in Gambia—jobless and frustrated, he joined thousands of others hoping for a better life abroad. But after being robbed, beaten, and imprisoned in Libya, he ended up right back where he started—without money or prospects.\n\nSaikou’s experience isn’t unique. Last year, nearly 2,500 Gambians were flown home from Libya, many after being freed from prisons amid reports of horrific abuses. These returnees are putting pressure on Gambia’s young government, which is still finding its feet after years of autocratic rule. Officials worry about unemployment and domestic security as they try to support these men and women who came back with little and often traumatized.\n\nTo tackle the root causes of migration, the European Union has been funding programs in Gambia aimed at job training and youth empowerment. Saikou himself took an EU-funded course in CCTV installation and is now saving for school. But so far, only a small fraction of returnees have received support packages that could help them restart their lives through education or business funding.\n\nThere are real challenges here. Some returnees live in remote areas or lack basic education, making assistance difficult. Offering help unevenly can also create tensions within communities or even encourage more people to try migrating. And without real economic opportunities or industries ready to absorb trained workers, many young people remain stuck in a cycle of frustration.\n\nDespite the risks they faced abroad, some Gambian youth still dream of Europe. Jerreh Cham, for example, is completing vocational training funded by the EU but plans to try again once qualified—believing that with skills in hand, he might earn respect and opportunity there.\n\nThis story highlights a crucial point: training and funding alone aren’t enough. Sustainable change will require broader economic development and real jobs at home to give young people reasons to stay.\n\nIn the end, Gambia’s struggle with migration is about more than just borders—it’s about hope, opportunity, and the urgent need to build futures where people already live."}]}

Over the past few years, Kindred’s Product and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) divisions have accomplished a tremendous amount in their respective domains, working independently to allow each team to optimize for their objectives.\nThe company has reached a point in its evolution where spinning off the AGI division maximizes the likelihood of success for both divisions, as well as returns to Kindred shareholders.\nGeordie Rose is stepping down as CEO and President of Kindred to lead this new entity named Sanctuary based in Vancouver, Canada. Kindred co-founder Suzanne Gildert will also be stepping down from her role as Chief Science Officer and will join Sanctuary as co-CEO. Sanctuary’s focus is on the implementation and testing of a specific framework for artificial general intelligence. The new entity will license some of Kindred’s patents and software, and Kindred will maintain a minority ownership in Sanctuary.\nKindred’s Board of Directors has appointed Jim Liefer, previously the company’s COO, to serve as CEO and President. As COO, Liefer brought strong executive leadership alongside co-founder, George Babu, for the development and deployment of Kindred’s first commercial product Sort, and will continue to lead the company in its mission to research and develop human-like intelligence in machines. The Kindred team in Toronto will continue its applied research in machine and reinforcement learning, with the San Francisco office focused on robotics, product development and commercialization.\nWith Kindred Sort, the company aims to alleviate the massive pressures facing the retail and fulfillment industry, which includes significant online sales growth, labor shortages, and a lack of advancement in technology. Kindred Sort allows retailers to manage the exploding growth and demand of this sector more efficiently. During the 2017 holiday season, Kindred’s robots sorted thousands of items ordered at speeds averaging over 410 units per hour, and reaching peak speeds of over 531 units per hour, freeing human workers to perform other parts of the fulfillment process critical to meet growing customer demand.\n“Kindred will maintain its commitment to building human-like intelligence in machines and applying those learnings to create and teach a new intelligent class of robots that will enhance the quality of our day-to-day lives, and in particular, the way we work,” said Liefer. “We look forward to advancing Kindred Sort, achieving new AI and robotic milestones while also helping to drive retail and other industries forward.”\nBabu, Kindred co-founder and Chief Product Officer will be joining Liefer on Kindred’s Board of Directors. Babu will continue to oversee product strategy and the expansion of Kindred’s partnerships and pilot programs with major global retailers.\nAbout Kindred\nKindred Systems Inc.’s mission is to build machines with human-like intelligence. The company’s central thesis is that intelligence requires a body. Since its founding in 2014, Kindred has been exploring and engineering systems that enable robots to understand and participate in our world, with the ultimate goal of a future where intelligent machines work together with people. Kindred is headquartered in San Francisco with an office in Toronto.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180105005243/en/\nThe Hatch Agency\nJudy Huang\nkindred.ai@thehatchagency.com\nSource: Kindred Systems Inc.\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into an exciting development in the world of artificial intelligence and robotics—how one company is evolving to bring human-like intelligence into machines, and what that means for industries like retail and fulfillment.\n\nKindred Systems has been on a mission since its founding in 2014: to build machines that think and act with human-like intelligence. Their core belief is that true intelligence requires a body—a robot that can understand and interact with the world around it. Over the years, they’ve made significant progress in both research and commercial applications, working through two main divisions: one focused on artificial general intelligence, or AGI, and the other on creating practical products.\n\nNow, Kindred is taking a big step by spinning off its AGI division into a new company called Sanctuary, based in Vancouver. This move allows each team to focus fully on their goals. Geordie Rose, the former CEO of Kindred, will lead Sanctuary alongside Suzanne Gildert, Kindred’s co-founder and former Chief Science Officer. Sanctuary will concentrate on testing and implementing a specific framework for AGI, licensing some of Kindred’s patents and software along the way. Meanwhile, Kindred retains a minority stake in Sanctuary.\n\nBack at Kindred, leadership is shifting as well. Jim Liefer, who was previously COO, steps up as CEO and President. He’s known for guiding the development of Kindred’s first commercial product called Sort. This product addresses real challenges in retail—think booming online sales, labor shortages, and outdated technology. Kindred Sort uses intelligent robots to sort thousands of items quickly and efficiently. For example, during the 2017 holiday season, these robots sorted items at an average speed of over 410 units per hour, peaking at more than 530 units per hour. This frees up human workers to focus on other important tasks within the fulfillment process.\n\nKindred continues to operate with teams split between Toronto and San Francisco. The Toronto office focuses on applied research in machine learning and reinforcement learning, while San Francisco handles robotics development and commercialization efforts.

(NASDAQ: CFFN) (the \"Company\") announced results today for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Detailed results will be available in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on or about February 8, 2018 and posted on our website, http://ir.capfed.com . For best viewing results, please view this release in Portable Document Format (PDF) on our website.\nHighlights for the quarter include:\ndividends paid of $50.4 million, or $0.375 per share; net income of $31.8 million, including a $7.5 million income tax benefit related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") enacted in December 2017; basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.24; and net interest margin of 1.83% (2.20% excluding the effects of the leverage strategy).\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized net income of $31.8 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to net income of $20.6 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The increase in net income was due primarily to a decrease in income tax expense resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, the impact of which was an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 for the current quarter.\nThe Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax laws, such as a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and changes to and/or limitations on certain income tax deductions. The Company has a fiscal year end of September 30th, so the change in the income tax rate will result in the use of a blended federal income tax rate for fiscal year 2018. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), the Company applied the blended federal income tax rate to pretax income in the current quarter and revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 22, 2017 to account for the future impact of a lower income tax rate. The revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities contributed $7.5 million to the decrease in income tax expense in the current quarter. The benefit of the lower income tax rate is partially offset by the Company recognizing more proportional amortization expense related to its low income housing partnerships in fiscal year 2018 resulting from an adjustment to account for a higher portion of those benefits realized prior to the income tax rate change. Management estimates the effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 to be between 20% and 21% and approximately 22% for fiscal year 2019.\nNet interest income decreased $284 thousand, or 0.6%, from the prior quarter to $49.4 million for the current quarter. The net interest margin decreased one basis point from 1.84% for the prior quarter to 1.83% for the current quarter. Excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, the net interest margin would have decreased one basis point from 2.21% for the prior quarter to 2.20% for the current quarter.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nThe weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets for the current quarter was 2.98%, unchanged from the prior quarter, while the average balance of interest-earning assets decreased $26.0 million between the two periods. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets would have decreased one basis point from the prior quarter, to 3.31%. The following table presents the components of interest and dividend income for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nChange Expressed in:\n2017\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nINTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME:\nLoans receivable\n$\n64,189\n$\n64,329\n$\n(140)\n(0.2)%\nCash and cash equivalents\n7,114\n6,669\n445\n6.7\nMortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\")\n5,252\n5,435\n(183)\n(3.4)\nFederal Home Loan Bank Topeka (\"FHLB\") stock\n3,095\n3,080\n15\n0.5\nInvestment securities\n994\n1,061\n(67)\n(6.3)\nTotal interest and dividend income\n$\n80,644\n$\n80,574\n$\n70\n0.1\nThe increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to a $70.4 million increase in the average balance, as well as a four basis point increase in the weighted average yield, to 1.29% for the current quarter, resulting from an increase in the yield earned on balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (the \"FRB of Kansas City\").\nInterest Expense\nThe weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities for the current quarter increased two basis points from the prior quarter, to 1.29%, while the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased $38.0 million between the two periods. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities for the current quarter would have increased one basis point from the prior quarter, to 1.29%. The following table presents the components of interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nChange Expressed in:\n2017\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nINTEREST EXPENSE:\nFHLB borrowings\n$\n17,917\n$\n18,099\n$\n(182)\n(1.0)%\nDeposits\n11,961\n11,313\n648\n5.7\nRepurchase agreements\n1,392\n1,504\n(112)\n(7.4)\nTotal interest expense\n$\n31,270\n$\n30,916\n$\n354\n1.1\nThe table above includes interest expense on FHLB borrowings both associated and not associated with the leverage strategy. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings not related to the leverage strategy decreased $451 thousand from the prior quarter due mainly to a four basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on the portfolio, to 2.08% for the current quarter, along with a $35.5 million decrease in the average balance of the portfolio. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings associated with the leverage strategy increased $268 thousand from the prior quarter due to a five basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid as a result of an increase in interest rates between periods.\nThe increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a five basis point increase in the weighted average rate, to 0.91% for the current quarter. The increase in the weighted average rate was primarily related to the certificate of deposit portfolio, which increased seven basis points to 1.51% for the current quarter.\nThe decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements was due to the maturity of a $100.0 million repurchase agreement during the quarter.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nCapitol Federal Savings Bank (the \"Bank\") did not record a provision for credit losses during the current quarter or the prior quarter. Based on management's assessment of the allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") formula analysis model and several other factors, it was determined that no provision for credit losses was necessary. Net loan charge-offs were $28 thousand during the current quarter compared to $88 thousand in the prior quarter. At December 31, 2017, loans 30 to 89 days delinquent were 0.25% of total loans and loans 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure were 0.15% of total loans.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest income for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nChange Expressed in:\n2017\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNON-INTEREST INCOME:\nRetail fees and charges\n$\n3,965\n$\n3,930\n$\n35\n0.9%\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\")\n534\n564\n(30)\n(5.3)\nOther non-interest income\n859\n1,401\n(542)\n(38.7)\nTotal non-interest income\n$\n5,358\n$\n5,895\n$\n(537)\n(9.1)\nThe decrease in other non-interest income was due primarily to a loss on the sale of loans during the current quarter compared to a gain on the sale of loans during the prior quarter as management continues to test loan sale processes for liquidity purposes, along with a decrease in insurance commissions resulting from the receipt of annual commissions from certain insurance providers during the prior quarter and no such commissions received during the current quarter.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nChange Expressed in:\n2017\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE:\nSalaries and employee benefits\n$\n10,528\n$\n11,049\n$\n(521)\n(4.7)%\nInformation technology and related expense\n3,331\n2,758\n573\n20.8\nOccupancy, net\n2,765\n2,716\n49\n1.8\nDeposit and loan transaction costs\n1,407\n1,366\n41\n3.0\nRegulatory and outside services\n1,140\n1,827\n(687)\n(37.6)\nFederal insurance premium\n852\n888\n(36)\n(4.1)\nAdvertising and promotional\n685\n1,398\n(713)\n(51.0)\nOffice supplies and related expense\n442\n511\n(69)\n(13.5)\nOther non-interest expense\n886\n966\n(80)\n(8.3)\nTotal non-interest expense\n$\n22,036\n$\n23,479\n$\n(1,443)\n(6.1)\nThe decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense was due primarily to the prior quarter including compensation expense on unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") shares related to the True Blue Capitol dividend paid during the prior fiscal year. The increase in information technology and related expense and the decrease in regulatory and outside services were due mainly to a change in the presentation of certain information technology professional and consulting expenses beginning in fiscal year 2018. Information technology professional and consulting expenses are now being reported in information technology and related expenses rather than regulatory and outside services. The decrease in advertising and promotional expense was due primarily to the timing of media campaigns and sponsorships.\nThe Company's efficiency ratio was 40.26% for the current quarter compared to 42.26% for the prior quarter. The change in the efficiency ratio was due primarily to lower non-interest expense in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter. The efficiency ratio is a measure of a financial institution's total non-interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income (pre-provision for credit losses) and non-interest income. A lower value indicates that the financial institution is generating revenue with a proportionally lower level of expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $860 thousand for the current quarter, compared to $11.5 million for the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was 2.6% for the current quarter compared to 35.8% for the prior quarter. The lower effective income tax rate and income tax expense were due primarily to revaluing the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as applying a lower corporate income tax rate to the Company's current quarter pretax income. Management estimates the effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 to be between 20% and 21% and approximately 22% for fiscal year 2019.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe Company recognized net income of $31.8 million, or $0.24 per share, for the current quarter compared to net income of $20.6 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was due primarily to a decrease in income tax expense resulting from the Tax Act being signed into law during the quarter.\nThe net interest margin increased 10 basis points, from 1.73% for the prior year quarter to 1.83% for the current quarter. Excludin\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s financial update. We’re diving into Capitol Federal Financial’s performance for the last quarter of 2017, highlighting some key results and what they mean moving forward.\n\nSo, what’s on the table? We’ll cover their net income, the impact of recent tax law changes, interest income and expenses, credit losses, and overall efficiency in their operations.\n\nStarting with the big picture, Capitol Federal Financial reported a net income of $31.8 million for the quarter ending December 31, 2017. That works out to 24 cents per share, which is a noticeable increase from $20.6 million, or 15 cents per share, in the previous quarter. A significant factor here was a $7.5 million income tax benefit due to revaluing deferred tax liabilities after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in December 2017.\n\nSpeaking of taxes, this new legislation reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% down to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Because Capitol Federal’s fiscal year ends in September, they’re using a blended tax rate for 2018. This adjustment lowered their tax expenses for the quarter and boosted earnings per share by about eight cents. However, some of these benefits are offset by increased amortization expenses related to low-income housing partnerships.\n\nNow, let’s look at their net interest income, which slightly decreased by about $284,000 to $49.4 million. Their net interest margin—a key measure of profitability—was essentially steady at 1.83%. Without considering their leverage strategy, this margin would be around 2.20%. The weighted average yield on interest-earning assets held steady at just under 3%, while interest expenses on liabilities saw a small increase in rates but a decrease in overall balances.\n\nOn the credit side, there were no provisions needed for credit losses this quarter. Loan charge-offs were minimal at $28,000, and delinquent loans remained low—about a quarter of a percent for loans overdue between 30 and 89 days.\n\nLooking beyond interest figures, non-interest income fell by about nine percent compared to the previous quarter. This was mainly due to a loss on loan sales and lower insurance commissions. On the expense front, overall non-interest expenses dropped by just over six percent, helped by lower salaries and employee benefits costs as well as reduced advertising spending.\n\nOne efficiency metric worth noting is their efficiency ratio—it improved from just over 42% to about 40%. This means Capitol Federal managed to generate revenue with relatively lower expenses this quarter.\n\nTo sum up, Capitol Federal Financial showed solid earnings growth in late 2017, largely fueled by favorable tax changes and effective cost management. Their core lending operations remain stable with low credit losses and steady interest margins. Looking ahead, they expect their effective tax rate to settle between 20% and 21% for this fiscal year.\n\nThat wraps up our look at Capitol Federal’s recent financial results—an insightful example of how tax policy shifts and operational efficiency can influence a company’s bottom line.

His net worth, including current equity holdings, is about $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The stock has returned more than 2,200 percent since its 1994 initial public offering, including reinvested dividends, compared with about 650 percent for the S&P 500 Financials Index. \nCapital One, the third-biggest U.S. credit-card lender, stands to benefit along with competitors including Discover Financial Services as President Donald Trump eased financial regulations and signed legislation that cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. \n“The best is yet to come” for U.S. banks, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients last month. “There is the potential for the industry to experience higher profitability and earnings growth against a backdrop of improved economic conditions, continued strong credit quality, a more constructive regulatory environment and further increases in interest rates.” \nFairbank is the fourth U.S. bank CEO to be identified as a billionaire by the Bloomberg index, joining JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Lloyd Blankfein and M&T Bancorp’s Bob Wilmers, who died last month. \nShares of Capital One rose 1.9 percent this year through Thursday, to a record $101.42, fueled by a stronger economic outlook and corporate tax cuts. \nFairbank and Nigel Morris, his colleague at a Washington-area consulting firm, started tinkering with new ways of parsing data to assess credit-card risk in the 1980s. They were hired in 1988 by Signet Bank, where they pioneered concepts such as tailored interest rates and created offers that enticed borrowers to transfer balances from other cards. \nThe business prospered and Signet spun off Capital One in the 1994 IPO, making Fairbank CEO. The company, based in McLean, Virginia, is now the seventh-biggest commercial bank by assets in the U.S. The firm also targets subprime borrowers, a fee-rich business that helped Fairbank double annual profit since 2005 to $3.75 billion in 2016. \nWhile Fairbank doesn’t collect a salary, over the past three years he has averaged more than $18 million in cash bonuses and stock and options awards from Capital One, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. He declined to comment through a company spokeswoman. \nFairbank, a father of eight, is one of about a dozen minority owners of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the group that owns five sports teams including the National Hockey League’s Washington Capitals, the Washington Wizards of the National Basketball Association, as well as the Capital One Arena, where both teams play. \nCapital One has been a prolific advertiser, pouring $13 billion into marketing since 2008, featuring celebrities including Jennifer Garner, Spike Lee, Charles Barkley, Alec Baldwin and Samuel L. Jackson. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about the story behind Capital One and its longtime leader, Richard Fairbank. You might recognize the catchy question from their ads: “What’s in your wallet?” But there’s a lot more to this company and its CEO than just memorable commercials.\n\nRichard Fairbank has been at the helm of Capital One for over 30 years. Under his leadership, the company grew from a small operation into one of the biggest credit-card lenders in the U.S. In fact, Capital One is now the third-largest in that space. Fairbank’s approach was innovative—he and his colleague Nigel Morris started experimenting back in the 1980s with new ways to analyze data to assess credit risk. This led to personalized interest rates and smart offers that encouraged people to transfer balances from other cards.\n\nCapital One went public in 1994, with Fairbank as CEO, and since then its stock has soared, delivering returns far beyond the average financial sector. The company also expanded into lending to subprime borrowers, a move that boosted profits significantly—doubling annual profits to nearly $3.75 billion by 2016.\n\nFairbank himself has seen considerable financial success from his role. Although he doesn’t take a salary, he’s earned millions through bonuses and stock awards over recent years. Today, his net worth is estimated at around $1.1 billion.\n\nThe company’s growth has been supported by broader economic factors too. Recent corporate tax cuts and eased financial regulations have created a more favorable environment for banks like Capital One. Analysts predict continued profitability and earnings growth as economic conditions improve.\n\nBeyond banking, Fairbank is involved in sports ownership as a minority owner of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns several Washington-area professional teams and venues.\n\nAnd while Capital One is known for its financial innovations, it’s also famous for its marketing—spending billions on advertising campaigns featuring celebrities like Jennifer Garner and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nIn short, Richard Fairbank’s vision and Capital One’s strategic moves have transformed a credit card startup into a powerhouse with strong financial performance and widespread recognition. It’s a clear example of how innovation, leadership, and timing can come together to build lasting success in the banking world."}]}

Today, we're diving into a recent financial move by the National Bank of Canada that might interest anyone following corporate debt markets or investment opportunities.\n\nSo, what’s happening? The National Bank of Canada has announced a new offering of medium-term notes. Specifically, they plan to issue $750 million worth of these notes. These are set to carry an interest rate of 3.183 percent and will mature on February 1, 2028.\n\nLet’s break that down. Medium-term notes are a type of debt instrument that companies use to raise capital. Investors who buy these notes are essentially lending money to the bank for a fixed period—in this case, ten years. In return, they receive regular interest payments at the stated rate.\n\nThe bank intends to issue these notes on February 1, 2018, with maturity exactly ten years later. This means investors will get their principal back on that date, assuming there are no unforeseen circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, the bank has mentioned a related offering involving NVCC subordinated notes. These types of notes generally rank lower than other debts in case of liquidation but may offer higher yields because of the added risk.\n\nTo sum it up, the National Bank of Canada is raising funds through a substantial issuance of medium-term notes with a fixed interest rate over a decade. This move reflects their financing strategy and provides investors with an opportunity to invest in a well-established financial institution.\n\nThat’s a quick look at the bank’s latest debt offering and what it means for investors and the market. Thanks for listening, and stay tuned for more insights into financial developments."}]}

If you’re curious about where key policymakers will be speaking and when crucial interest rate decisions are scheduled, this overview will keep you informed on what to watch for in the weeks ahead.\n\nWe’ll cover highlights from late January through March, focusing on speeches, meetings, and announcements from institutions like the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and others. These events often shape financial markets and give insight into the global economy’s direction.\n\nStarting off, January 30th features several important appearances. In Paris, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau speaks at a fintech conference, followed by a panel discussion with finance ministers from France, Belgium, Lithuania, and Luxembourg on the future of finance in Europe. Meanwhile, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will appear before the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee in London. Also kicking off is the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC two-day meeting on interest rates.\n\nMoving into early February, expect a flurry of speeches and conferences. ECB executive board members and central bank governors from France and Ireland will speak in Dublin. The Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves will discuss monetary policy and financial stability risks in Oslo. The Bank of Japan will have its Deputy Governor addressing business leaders in Oita. On February 1st, the ECB’s chief economist Peter Praet will speak in Brussels.\n\nThroughout the first two weeks of February, you’ll see a mix of regional Federal Reserve presidents sharing their views on the economy at various conferences across the U.S., including Dallas, San Francisco, Lexington, and Des Moines. The ECB also has multiple events planned in Frankfurt discussing topics like payments systems and digital currencies.\n\nImportant policy announcements are scheduled too. For example, on January 31st, the Federal Reserve’s FOMC releases its interest rate decision followed by a statement. The Bank of England will release its inflation report and interest rate decision on February 8th. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand also plans to announce its official cash rate that day.\n\nLooking ahead to March, several central banks will hold key meetings. The Federal Reserve’s FOMC convenes again starting March 20th with an interest rate decision announced on March 21st alongside a press conference by the Fed chair. The ECB Governing Council meets on March 8th with an interest rate announcement expected. The Bank of Japan has its monetary policy meeting spanning March 8-9. And other central banks such as Sweden’s Riksbank and Canada’s Bank will hold policy meetings or release minutes throughout this period.\n\nIn summary, the coming weeks are packed with central bank speeches, policy meetings, and announcements that provide vital clues about economic conditions and monetary policy directions globally. Keeping an eye on these dates can help anyone interested in economics or finance stay ahead of market-moving developments.\n\nThanks for joining me for this overview. Stay tuned for more updates as these important events unfold."}]}

Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff (D-CA) speaks after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions attended a closed door interview with the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol in Washington, U.S., November 30, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nThose witnesses would include Trump’s daughter Ivanka and Steve Bannon, his former adviser, U.S. Representative Adam Schiff told reporters. He also said he would like Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner to appear again before the committee while noting that the choice of witnesses is determined by the panel’s Republican leadership. Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Susan Thomas\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into the ongoing investigation into whether President Trump’s 2016 campaign had any connections with Russia. It’s a topic that’s been in the headlines for quite some time, and now, the focus is on potential new witnesses who could shed more light on the situation.\n\nThe top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff from California, recently spoke about the investigation. He mentioned that there are dozens of people he’d like to call to testify before the committee. These aren’t just any witnesses—they include some high-profile figures close to President Trump.\n\nAmong those Schiff specifically named are Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, and Steve Bannon, who served as a senior adviser during the campaign. Schiff also expressed interest in having Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, appear again before the committee. This suggests they’re looking to gather more detailed information from people who were directly involved in or close to the campaign.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that while Schiff can suggest witnesses, the final decision on who gets called rests with the Republican leadership of the committee. So, there’s a bit of a political dynamic at play when it comes to moving forward with these testimonies.\n\nIn summary, the investigation is far from over. With dozens of potential witnesses on the list—including key figures like Ivanka Trump, Steve Bannon, and Jared Kushner—the House Intelligence Committee is gearing up for more interviews that could provide deeper insights into what really happened during that election cycle."}]}

Specifically, Klövern has issued new bonds totaling 1.5 billion Swedish kronor. \n\nThese bonds come with a few key features. First, they have a maturity period of about three years. That means investors who buy these bonds can expect them to reach their final maturity around February 2021. \n\nThe interest rate on these bonds is floating, which means it’s not fixed. Instead, it’s tied to the three-month STIBOR rate — that’s the Stockholm Interbank Offered Rate — plus an additional 3.5 percentage points, or 350 basis points. This setup allows the interest payments to adjust over time, depending on changes in the underlying reference rate.\n\nTo sum it up, Klövern has raised capital by issuing bonds with a three-year term and a floating interest rate linked to the STIBOR, providing flexibility for both the company and investors as market rates fluctuate. It’s a straightforward financial move that reflects how companies manage funding through debt instruments in today’s markets."}]}

We’ll break down their production numbers, reserves growth, exploration strategy, and investment outlook.\n\nIn 2017, Aker BP significantly boosted its reserves. They added a net 202 million barrels of oil equivalents, bringing their total reserves to 913 million barrels. That’s a substantial increase and reflects strong growth in their asset base. Alongside this, their contingent resources—those potential reserves that are less certain but still promising—also grew by about 30 percent to 785 million barrels.\n\nWhen it comes to production, Aker BP’s pro-forma output in 2017 was around 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For 2018, they expected production to remain steady between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels per day, with an average production cost of about 12 dollars per barrel. Looking further ahead, the company sees potential to ramp up production to 330,000 barrels per day by 2023 with its current portfolio.\n\nAker BP is also committed to maintaining a strong reserve replacement ratio. In 2017, their organic reserve replacement ratio was 2.3 times their production, while the total ratio was an impressive 4.5 times. This means they’re adding more reserves than they’re extracting, which is crucial for long-term sustainability.\n\nExploration remains a key focus for them. Between 2016 and 2020, they aimed to discover a net of 250 million barrels of oil and gas. In 2018 alone, they planned to drill 12 exploration wells with estimated volumes ranging from 50 to 150 million barrels net to the company. They’re also evaluating additional infill wells at fields like Ula and Tambar, with Tambar’s redevelopment well underway and first oil expected in 2018.\n\nOn the investment side, Aker BP forecasted capital expenditures around 1.3 billion dollars for 2018. Exploration expenses and decommissioning costs were each expected to be about 350 million dollars. Notably, production from the Alvheim FPSO increased thanks to new wells at Viper-Kobra and Volund infills, with more infill drilling planned to manage decline rates and keep unit costs low.\n\nFinally, the company has an ambition to produce another billion barrels of oil equivalent from the Valhall area—a significant target that underscores their focus on maximizing value from existing assets.\n\nIn summary, Aker BP demonstrated strong reserve growth and steady production in recent years while setting clear goals for exploration and expansion. With disciplined investments and ongoing development projects, they’re positioning themselves for sustainable growth in the years ahead."}]}

On Sunday night at PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina, Vegas delivered a powerful showing against the Carolina Hurricanes, cruising to a 5-1 victory.\n\nHere’s what went down. Colin Miller led the charge for Vegas, scoring one goal and assisting on two others. He wasn’t alone in finding the net—Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, Jonathan Marchessault, James Neal, and Brendan Leipsic also scored. The team came close to hitting six goals, which is something they’ve only managed twice this season.\n\nVegas goalie Marc-Andre Fleury was solid between the pipes, stopping 27 shots in total and shutting down all 18 shots he faced in the last two periods. On the other side, Carolina made a goalie switch after Vegas scored their third goal just under 13 minutes into the game. Scott Darling started in goal but was replaced by Cam Ward after allowing three goals on eight shots. Darling’s recent struggles continued with this loss.\n\nThe Hurricanes did manage to cut into the lead late in the first period with Jaccob Slavin scoring a power-play goal, making it 3-1 before the period ended. But that early three-goal surge from Vegas was unexpected since they’ve scored fewer first-period goals than any other period this season.\n\nThis win wrapped up a four-game road trip for Vegas where they earned five out of eight possible points—a solid return. Meanwhile, Carolina’s home woes continued; this was their fourth straight home loss, and they’ve struggled to find consistency after a five-day break and with the All-Star weekend approaching.\n\nIn summary, Vegas showed strong offense early and reliable goaltending to secure a convincing win on the road, while Carolina faced challenges both in goal and on home ice. It’s a reminder of how quickly momentum can shift in hockey and how important it is to capitalize early—and keep that pressure up throughout the game."}]}

The wall of worry was probably the cornerstone of this bull market. … That is gone,\" the chief investment officer at the Lethold Group said in an interview with \" Power Lunch .\" \n\"That opens you up to the bear's bite,\" he added. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average broke above 26,000 for the first time on Tuesday , less than a month after hitting its record 25,000. However, stocks pulled back later in the afternoon as investors weighed the possibility of a government shutdown. Full-fledged correction? \nWhile Paulsen isn't exiting the market right now, he does think it is technically overbought and due for a pause. \n\"The pressures are building … particularly if inflation picks up in any major way here … of not just a pullback but a full-fledged 10 or 15 percent correction sometime this year,\" he said. \nIn the meantime, if the market continues \"roaring ahead,\" with the S&P 500 breaking through 3,000 and the 10-year Treasury yield heading up toward 3 percent, Paulsen said he then may get more defensive with cash. \nFor now, though, he would look to own more capital goods stocks and fewer consumer and bond-like names.Richard Weiss, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at American Century Investments, believes it makes sense right now to sell some equities. \n\"We've ridden this bull for all it's worth,\" he told \"Power Lunch.\" \nIf investors want to hedge their bets, Weiss suggests cash, which he called the \"safest place to be,\" or the CBOE Volatility Index. \n\"I don't know that there's any safe havens in the [U.S.] stock market at this point,\" he said. \n— CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about the current state of the stock market and what some top strategists are saying about its momentum and the risks ahead.\n\nThe market has been showing impressive gains, with broad participation and strong price momentum. Just recently, the Dow Jones industrial average crossed 26,000 for the first time, less than a month after hitting 25,000. But beneath this optimism, some experts are sounding a note of caution.\n\nJim Paulsen, chief investment officer at the Lethold Group, points out that the usual “wall of worry” that has supported this bull market throughout the recovery seems to have disappeared. That widespread caution helped keep things balanced before, but now with optimism running so high, he warns it could leave the market vulnerable. He describes this optimism as “really overwhelming,” which is unusual for this stage.\n\nPaulsen isn’t suggesting pulling out of the market just yet. Instead, he thinks stocks are technically overbought and due for a pause. He highlights that if inflation starts to rise significantly, we could see not just a simple pullback but a more serious correction — possibly a drop of 10 to 15 percent sometime this year.\n\nIf the market keeps pushing forward, with key levels like the S&P 500 breaking through 3,000 and Treasury yields moving higher toward 3 percent, Paulsen says he might become more defensive by holding more cash. For now, though, he favors owning more capital goods stocks and fewer consumer-focused or bond-like investments.\n\nMeanwhile, Richard Weiss from American Century Investments also suggests it might be wise to take some profits off the table. He recommends cash as a safe place to be right now or using tools like the CBOE Volatility Index to hedge bets. Weiss points out that there aren’t really any clear safe havens within U.S. stocks at this point.\n\nSo, while the market continues to climb and excitement is high, these experts remind us that challenges are increasing beneath the surface. It might be time to prepare for some turbulence ahead by considering a more cautious approach.\n\nIn summary, strong momentum is driving stocks higher, but with optimism at a peak and potential inflation pressures looming, a pause or correction could be on the horizon. Keeping an eye on market signals and balancing your exposure may be key in navigating what comes next."}]}

After some legal back-and-forth, the administrators responsible for handling the airline’s bankruptcy from both Germany and Austria have announced they’ll work closely together to finalize a deal for the airline’s future.\n\nHere’s what’s been happening: Niki, the airline in question, went into insolvency, meaning it couldn’t meet its financial obligations. Initially, the German administrator, Lucas Floether, was managing the process. He had already agreed to sell Niki to IAG, the parent company of British Airways. But then an Austrian court ruled that the main insolvency proceedings should move to Austria. This complicated things and led Floether to consider legal action against that ruling.\n\nNow, in a joint statement, Floether and his Austrian counterpart Ulla Reisch have said they will cooperate closely to seal a deal. They emphasized that signatures from both administrators will provide legal security for closing the sales contract. That means buyers can be confident that any deal they make will be legally sound.\n\nThey also mentioned that bidders who had participated in earlier rounds still have until Friday to submit new offers. So, there’s still a window open for potential buyers to step forward.\n\nTo sum it up, after some initial conflict over jurisdiction and legal control, the German and Austrian administrators are now working together to ensure a smooth sale process for Niki. Their joint effort aims to give buyers confidence and hopefully secure the airline’s future through a finalized deal."}]}

Spot gold was up 0.3 percent at $1,342.50 an ounce by 0718 GMT after touching its strongest since Sept. 8 at $1,344.44. Spot gold rose for a fifth straight week last week, gaining 1.4 percent. U.S. gold futures were up 0.5 percent at $1,341.90 an ounce. \"While the weaker dollar remained gold's primary driver, investors are keeping an eye on the simmering geopolitical hot spot in the Middle East,\" said Stephen Innes, APAC head of trading at OANDA. \"Iran remains among the most poignant of geopolitical risks this year following President Trump's decision not to ratify Iran's compliance on the nuclear deal ... Gold investors are likely under-positioned for a significant escalation which could lead to considerable price increase.\" Iran's president said on Sunday the United States had failed to undermine a nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers, and hailed the accord as a \"long-lasting victory\" for Iran, state television reported. U.S. on Friday delivered an ultimatum to European signatories of the deal to fix the \"terrible flaws\" of the agreement with Iran, or the United States would pull out. The dollar index dropped 0.2 percent to 90.810. Earlier in the session, it hit a low of 90.622 , its worst since Jan. 2015. The recent drop in U.S. unemployment could spark a surge in inflation that, given the Federal Reserve's current policy framework, could trigger interest-rate hikes that bring on a recession, Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren warned on Friday. Higher rates could dent demand for non-interest-paying gold. Adding a touch of bullishness to gold was the data from U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday, which showed that hedge funds and money managers raised their net long positions in COMEX gold and silver contracts in the week to Jan. 9. Spot gold may break a resistance at $1,341 per ounce and rise to the Sept. 8, 2017 high of $1,357.54, as suggested by a retracement analysis, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Among other precious metals, palladium rose 1 percent to $1,135 on Monday, after hitting a record high of $1,138 early in the session. The metal has seen a sustained rally from high demand in the auto industry amid a supply deficit, analysts said. Spot silver rose 0.7 percent to $17.26 an ounce, after touching a near three-month high at $17.42. Platinum was up 0.3 percent at $996.95, after touching its highest since Sept. 11 at $1,001.40 on Monday. (Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by Sunil Nair and Biju Dwarakanath)\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about the recent movements in gold and other precious metals, and what’s driving these changes in the market.\n\nGold prices have been on the rise, reaching their highest levels in over four months. This increase is largely due to a weaker U.S. dollar, which recently dropped to its lowest point against a basket of currencies in three years. When the dollar weakens, gold tends to become more attractive as an investment, pushing its price higher. Spot gold climbed to around $1,342 an ounce and even touched $1,344 at one point, marking a steady upward trend that has lasted for five straight weeks.\n\nBut it’s not just the dollar influencing gold. Geopolitical tensions, especially involving Iran and the Middle East, are also playing a significant role. Investors are watching closely because any escalation in this region could lead to further price increases. For example, Iran's president recently emphasized that the nuclear deal with major powers remains intact despite U.S. pressure to fix what it calls \"terrible flaws.\" This uncertainty keeps gold in focus as a safe haven.\n\nAt the same time, data shows that hedge funds and money managers have increased their long positions in gold and silver contracts. This suggests growing confidence or anticipation of rising prices among big investors.\n\nLooking ahead, technical analysis points to gold potentially breaking through resistance levels around $1,341 per ounce and possibly reaching highs not seen since early September 2017—around $1,357.\n\nOther precious metals are also seeing gains. Palladium hit record highs above $1,130 an ounce due to strong demand from the auto industry combined with supply shortages. Silver and platinum have also climbed, with silver nearing three-month highs and platinum reaching levels last seen in September.\n\nIn summary, gold and other precious metals are benefiting from a weaker dollar, geopolitical uncertainties, and increased investor interest. These factors together suggest we may see continued strength in this sector in the near term."}]}

A 5 percent VAT on a broad range of goods and services came into effect on the same day.\nThe new payment orders were an acknowledgment of “the increased burdens for some segments of the population following from the necessary measures which the state took to restructure the economy,” according to the decree.\nKing Salman directed the state to bear the burden of VAT in some situations, including special health and education services as well as the first purchase of a house that is valued at up to 850,000 riyals ($226,660). Allowances for students, retirees and social security recipients were also boosted.\nThe decree did not reveal the total cost of the new allowances, but it appeared to be considerably smaller than some past handouts by Saudi kings, and therefore unlikely to have much impact on economic growth or the state budget deficit.\nAbout 1.18 million Saudis are employed in the government sector and there are more than 1.23 million pensioners and beneficiaries of pension payments, the central bank says. That suggests a total package cost of about 23 billion riyals, according to Reuters calculations.\nThat compares to a projected 2018 deficit of 195 billion riyals, according to a budget plan released last month. A package of handouts marking King Salman’s accession to the throne in early 2015 was estimated to cost more than 100 billion riyals.\nSaudi Arabia will slow plans to eliminate subsidies for a wide range of energy products, according to a new long-term fiscal plan in the 2018 state budget.\n(This version of the story was refiled to add dropped budget deficit figure; paragraph 8)\nReporting by Stephen Kalin and Andrew Torchia; Editing by Chris Reese and Clarence Fernandez\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about some recent economic moves in Saudi Arabia that are shaping the lives of millions of people. The kingdom has introduced new payments to help state employees and military personnel cope with rising living costs following major changes in government policy.\n\nHere’s what’s happening. Saudi Arabia recently increased domestic gas prices and introduced a value-added tax, or VAT, on a wide range of goods and services. These changes are part of a larger effort to diversify the country’s economy, which has traditionally relied heavily on oil exports. With gasoline prices roughly doubling and a 5 percent VAT now in place, everyday expenses have gone up for many Saudis.\n\nIn response, King Salman issued a royal decree to provide financial relief. State employees will receive an extra 1,000 riyals a month—about 267 dollars—over the next year to help offset the higher costs. Military personnel serving on the front lines in Yemen will get a one-time payment of 5,000 riyals. Beyond these payments, the government has also boosted allowances for students, retirees, and social security recipients.\n\nThe decree recognizes that these measures to restructure the economy have increased burdens on certain groups. To ease some of this strain, the government will cover VAT costs in specific cases, such as special health and education services, and for first-time homebuyers purchasing houses valued up to 850,000 riyals.\n\nWhile these payments offer some relief, they are smaller than previous handouts from the Saudi monarchy and are unlikely to significantly impact economic growth or the budget deficit. For context, about 1.18 million Saudis work in government jobs, and over 1.23 million receive pensions or social security benefits. Taken together, the new payments might cost around 23 billion riyals, which is modest compared to a projected budget deficit of 195 billion riyals for 2018.\n\nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia plans to slow down the removal of subsidies on various energy products as part of its long-term fiscal strategy outlined in the 2018 state budget.\n\nTo sum up, Saudi Arabia is adjusting its economic policies by introducing taxes and raising energy prices while providing targeted financial support to soften the impact on public employees and vulnerable groups. It’s a delicate balancing act as the kingdom moves toward a more diversified economy while managing social and fiscal challenges along the way."}]}

He shot a solid 70 on Saturday, putting him at 15 under par for the tournament. That’s just one stroke ahead of South Africa’s own Branden Grace, who is not only the home favorite but also the highest-ranked player in the field at number 30 in the world.\n\nPaisley’s round included three birdies, which helped him stay in front, although he did have a setback with a bogey on the 16th hole.

But despite his achievements, he’s still chasing his first win at his country’s Open championship—a tournament with deep roots going back to 1903, making it the second oldest national Open in golf.\n\nJust behind them, a small group is within striking distance.

Return on stock investment in 2017 hit 118.4 billion yuan, up 355.5 percent, while return on bonds reached 208.7 billion yuan over the same period, up 11.07 percent on-year. $1 = 6.4061 Chinese yuan Reporting by Shu Zhang and Matthew Miller in Beijing; Writing by Engen Tham in Shanghai; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Sam Holmes\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s episode, where we’re taking a closer look at some significant shifts in China’s insurance industry during 2017. It’s a story about regulatory crackdowns, changing investment strategies, and what it all means for one of the world’s largest insurance markets.\n\nSo, what happened in China’s insurance sector last year? Let’s break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there was a sharp decline in universal life insurance fund assets. These funds dropped by more than half—about 50.3 percent—falling to roughly 636 billion yuan. This wasn’t just a random market fluctuation. It came as Chinese regulators ramped up efforts to tackle financial risks and misconduct within the sector. Specifically, they cracked down on some insurers who had been using high-yield, short-term life insurance products to raise money for long-term investments, including buying stakes in publicly traded companies. Some executives faced penalties as part of this cleanup.\n\nDespite this drop in universal life funds, the overall insurance market still grew, just at a slower pace than before. Total premium income—the money people paid into insurance policies—increased by 18 percent in 2017, reaching about 3.66 trillion yuan. That’s a solid gain, but it’s down from the 27.5 percent growth seen in 2016.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, total assets held by insurance companies climbed to 16.75 trillion yuan by the end of the year, up nearly 11 percent. Investment income also rose by just over 18 percent to around 835 billion yuan, with an investment yield of about 5.77 percent—slightly higher than the previous year.\n\nProfits in the industry saw an impressive jump too, hitting close to 257 billion yuan—a nearly 30 percent increase. Returns on stock investments surged dramatically by over 350 percent, while bond returns also grew by about 11 percent.\n\nThe China Insurance Regulatory Commission has made it clear that this tighter oversight will continue, with plans to address risks in the industry over the next three years. Their focus remains on equity ownership structures, capital adequacy, and investment practices.\n\nTo sum up, while China’s universal life insurance funds took a big hit amid regulatory crackdowns in 2017, the broader insurance market showed resilience with steady growth in premiums, assets, and profits. The industry is navigating a period of adjustment as regulators work to ensure more stable and transparent practices moving forward.\n\nThanks for joining me today as we unpacked these important developments in China’s insurance world. Until next time!"}]}

Customers stand next to shopping trolleys as they shop in a Carrefour hypermarket in Nice, France, April 6, 2016. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard/File Photo \nCarrefour’s new boss Alexandre Bompard will present a strategy plan on Jan. 23, and his ambitions regarding digital and online businesses could form a key part of this. \nCarrefour said late on Thursday it will buy 17 percent of Showroomprive.com for 79 million euros (70.37 million pounds), from Steinhoff-owned ( SNHJ.J ) furniture chain Conforama. \nThe acquisition helped lift Carrefour shares by around 1 percent on Friday, outperforming a 0.6 percent rise in the broader European retail sector .SXRP, while Showroomprive shares jumped 50 percent. \nAnalysts at brokerage Bryan Garnier said the deal was “hopefully ... a first step towards more announcements on 23rd January,” and kept a “buy” rating on Carrefour shares. \nLast July Bompard, former boss of France’s top electronics retailer Fnac Darty ( FNAC.PA ), became CEO at Carrefour, the world’s largest retailer after Walmart ( WMT.N ). \nCarrefour issued a profit warning in August and Bompard is under pressure to improve results in its core French market. \nCarrefour has been losing market share to unlisted rival Leclerc, and investors also want Bompard to speed up an expansion into e-commerce where its lags domestic rivals and faces competition from online giant Amazon ( AMZN.O ). \nHe has also faced pressure after French rival Casino ( CASP.PA ) agreed to use Ocado’s ( OCDO.L ) e-commerce platform to expand its online grocery business. \n“A partnership with a web bulge-bracket might lend more credibility to Carrefour’s digital project, as would a partnership, if not a tie-up with Galeries Lafayette,” Bryan Garnier analysts added in a research note. \nThe Moulin family, which owns department store Galeries Lafayette, is the top shareholder in Carrefour with a near 10 percent stake. \nBernstein analysts said the Showroomprive deal could boost traffic in Carrefour stores, although they added it was nevertheless “fairly negligible” and Carrefour faced bigger issues over its underperforming food retail business. FEARS ABOUT BIG JOB CUTS \nBompard is also expected to back a restructuring on Jan. 23 that some analysts estimate could involve a billion euros. \nOptions for the French market include turning some stores into franchises, moving others to lease management, closing loss-making ones as well as Sunday opening. \nThere could also be some head office restructuring and more price cuts to attract shoppers, union sources have said. \nThe CGT and Force Ouvriere trade unions fear the restructuring could lead to 4,500-5,000 job cuts in France. Carrefour has declined to comment. \nDejan Terglav, FO secretary general, told Reuters on Friday his union was calling for a day of protests on Feb. 8. \n“If the plan does not suit us, it will be war,” he warned. \nCarrefour is the largest private sector employer in France, with 115,000 French staff out of a global workforce of 384,000.

Carrefour, one of the world’s largest retailers, has taken a notable step by acquiring a significant stake in an online fashion retailer, Showroomprive.com. This move has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, signaling a potential shift in Carrefour’s strategy.\n\nSo, what exactly happened? Carrefour announced it would buy 17 percent of Showroomprive.com for 79 million euros. This deal came from Conforama, a furniture chain owned by Steinhoff. The market reacted positively—Carrefour’s shares rose about 1 percent, outperforming the broader European retail sector, and Showroomprive’s shares jumped by a remarkable 50 percent.\n\nThis acquisition is seen as more than just a financial investment. Alexandre Bompard, who became Carrefour’s CEO last July after leading France’s top electronics retailer Fnac Darty, is expected to reveal a broader strategy plan later this month. His focus seems to be on strengthening Carrefour’s presence in digital and e-commerce, areas where the company has lagged behind competitors like Amazon and local rival Leclerc.\n\nCarrefour has been under pressure to improve its core French market performance after issuing a profit warning last August. Investors want Bompard to accelerate Carrefour’s expansion into online retail and digital partnerships. For example, analysts suggest that teaming up with other major players or department stores could add credibility to Carrefour’s digital ambitions.\n\nBut there are challenges ahead. Bompard is also expected to announce a major restructuring plan in France that could involve closing some stores, changing management models, and possibly cutting thousands of jobs. This has sparked concern among unions who are already planning protests.\n\nIn summary, Carrefour is clearly making moves to embrace digital retail through its investment in Showroomprive.com, signaling a shift toward e-commerce under new leadership. However, balancing this transformation with the realities of its traditional business and workforce will be a complex task in the months ahead."}]}

Manila last year renamed it the “Philippine Rise”.\nThough China does not lay claim to the area, the lingering presence of its vessels for several months in late 2016 triggered concern about its intentions.\nThe Philippines granting of the permission to China was not announced and was revealed a few days ago by a lawmaker who has been fiercely critical of Duterte’s close ties with Beijing.\nThe Philippines and China have a long history of maritime squabbles over sovereignty in the South China Sea, but there has been no disagreement about waters off Manila’s Pacific coast.\nRoque said anyone opposed to the joint research project should go to Congress and raise the issue there.\n“If this is not a wise move of the president, then a law could be enacted to prohibit it,” he said.\nThe Philippines would grant permission to any other country that might show interest in conducting maritime research at Benham Rise, he added. (Reporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty, Robert Birsel)\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into a topic that touches on science, sovereignty, and international relations—all centered around a vast area of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the Philippines called Benham Rise.\n\nSo, what’s going on there? Benham Rise is a large underwater region, roughly the size of Greece, recognized by the United Nations as part of the Philippine continental shelf since 2012. In fact, just last year, the Philippines officially renamed it the “Philippine Rise.” Scientists believe this area is rich in biodiversity and a prime habitat for tuna, making it an important spot for marine research.\n\nNow, here’s where it gets interesting. The Philippine government, under President Rodrigo Duterte, made a decision to allow China to conduct scientific research in this area. This wasn’t a minor move—it was a personal decision by Duterte himself. The Chinese research is being done in partnership with the University of the Philippines.\n\nThis decision has sparked some concern among critics who worry about potential threats to Philippine maritime sovereignty. After all, the Philippines and China have a complicated history when it comes to maritime disputes, especially in the South China Sea. However, it’s important to note that China doesn’t claim Benham Rise itself, and there haven’t been any official disagreements over these specific waters. Still, Chinese vessels were present in the area for several months back in 2016, which raised some eyebrows.\n\nInterestingly, the permission granted to China wasn’t publicly announced at first. It only came to light recently through a lawmaker who has been critical of Duterte’s close relationship with Beijing.\n\nThe President’s spokesman responded by saying that if anyone has concerns about this joint research project, they should bring those concerns to Congress. He also mentioned that if people believe this was not a wise decision, then laws could be passed to prohibit such arrangements in the future. Furthermore, he added that the Philippines would be open to allowing other countries interested in maritime research at Benham Rise to do so as well.\n\nTo sum it up: The Philippine government is allowing China to conduct scientific research at Benham Rise—a significant marine area recognized as part of the Philippines—under a decision made personally by President Duterte. While some worry about sovereignty issues given past tensions with China, there hasn’t been any formal dispute over this particular region. And importantly, the door remains open for other nations interested in studying this rich marine environment.\n\nIt’s a situation that highlights how science and geopolitics can intersect in complex ways—and one worth keeping an eye on as it unfolds."}]}

The market showed a bit of a balancing act, with some sectors climbing while others slipped, leaving the overall index almost unchanged.\n\nSo, what happened exactly? The S&P/TSX composite index closed just a hair higher—up 1.59 points or 0.01 percent—ending at 16,319.24. It was a day where gains in certain areas offset losses in others, creating a kind of standstill for the market as a whole.\n\nLet’s break down the details. Six out of ten major groups in the index saw gains. Notably, the energy sector led the way with a solid 1.2 percent increase. This was helped by rising U.S. crude oil prices, which hit their highest level since December 2014. The rise in oil prices is linked to OPEC’s production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have been shrinking for eight straight weeks. Energy companies like Encana Corp benefited from this trend, with their shares climbing nearly 3 percent after announcing better-than-expected production forecasts.\n\nOn the flip side, the materials sector took a hit, falling about 1 percent. This group includes companies involved in mining precious and base metals as well as fertilizer production. Gold prices dipped slightly, which put pressure on major miners like Kinross Gold and Barrick Gold, whose shares dropped by nearly 4 percent and just under 1 percent respectively. Nutrien Ltd, a newly formed fertilizer company from a recent merger, also saw its stock fall by close to 2 percent.\n\nThere was some excitement in the real estate and marijuana sectors too. Pure Industrial Real Estate Trust surged over 20 percent after receiving an all-cash buyout offer from an affiliate of Blackstone Group. Meanwhile, marijuana producers Canopy Growth and Aphria were among the biggest winners, with shares rising more than 4 percent each.\n\nIn summary, the Canadian market ended the day almost flat because gains in energy, real estate, and cannabis stocks balanced out losses in materials driven by lower gold prices. It’s a reminder of how different sectors can move in opposite directions but still keep the overall market steady.\n\nThat’s our snapshot of today’s market action—showing us how various forces play off each other to shape the bigger picture."}]}

The company's stock rose 2.5 percent in early trading Monday. \nGBH Insights chief strategy officer and head of technology Daniel Ives believes Netflix's subscription addition estimate was low, and expects that price increases did not drive that many people away, while the movie \"Bright\" and new seasons of \"The Crown\" and \"Stranger Things\" kept users around.\nThrough surveys, GBH Insights believes net ads this quarter will approach 7 million.\n\"They were a little conservative on guidance on domestic given the price increase, but we didn't see any chinks in the armor,\" Ives said, adding that he expects the company to have a more profitable trajectory relative to the past two years. \nshow chapters Even at this stage of the game, it may not be too late to buy Netflix      2:41 AM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 01:30 Forrester principal analyst Jim Nail said the holidays tend to be a strong quarter for Netflix, leading him to believe it will post large subscriber ads this quarter than projected. \nAnd while it is spending up to $8 billion on content this year, the large figure is a \"necessary evil\" to remain competitive against other services, Ives said. \n\"We're just continuing to see the cord cutting phenomenon going into Netflix's lap,\" he said.\nThere are some questions going forward about the negative impact of Disney removing its content from Netflix in 2019 and Disney's larger ownership stake in Hulu due to the Disney- Fox deal , Ives said, but he expects to see the impact more in the latter half of 2018.\n\"If [CEO Reed] Hastings wakes up at night with a nightmare, it's Iger and Disney,\" Ives said. \"Going into this earnings it needs to be a beat and raise type of outlook. The stock has had a huge run. We still think it's in its fifth or sixth inning.\" \nIt's also questionable whether Netflix can sustain subscriber interest at the current pricing level, and Forrester's Nail expects more price increases to come.\nWhile the company doesn't have to have a hit with each show because it's not dependent on advertising, it still has to have enough hits to ensure people will be willing to pay for the service each month. \n\"They redefine what is good and crap,\" Nail said. \"Their business is no longer defined by, 'Does the show generate a big enough audience for advertisers?' What you and I may think is crap, somebody may watch it and like it. They'll see a $12 charge on their credit card bill, but will that show be enough to pay $12 for Netflix?\"\nAnalysts expect Netflix to post EPS of 41 cents on revenue of $3.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into what’s shaping up to be a strong quarter for Netflix. With the company set to report earnings soon, there’s a lot of buzz around subscriber growth and how it’s impacting their business.\n\nSo, what’s driving this optimism? Analysts are expecting Netflix to exceed its own subscriber growth estimate of 6.3 million. In fact, some experts think that number is actually conservative. One big reason? Popular shows like “Bright,” along with new seasons of “The Crown” and “Stranger Things,” have kept viewers engaged and less likely to cancel their subscriptions.\n\nInterestingly, despite recent price increases, it seems customers haven’t been deterred. Surveys suggest that Netflix could add close to 7 million subscribers this quarter. This points to a strong demand for the service, even as it adjusts its pricing.\n\nNow, Netflix is spending heavily on content—up to eight billion dollars this year—to stay competitive in a crowded streaming market. While that might sound like a lot, it’s seen as a necessary investment as more people cut traditional cable in favor of streaming options like Netflix.\n\nLooking ahead, there are some challenges on the horizon. Disney plans to pull its content from Netflix in 2019 and is increasing its stake in Hulu, which could impact Netflix’s subscriber growth later this year. Still, for now, Netflix appears well-positioned and is expected to continue growing profitably.\n\nAnother point to consider is whether Netflix can keep subscribers interested at current prices. Some analysts expect more price hikes in the future. Since Netflix isn’t reliant on advertising revenue, it doesn’t need every show to be a massive hit. Instead, it needs enough content that viewers feel their monthly fee is worth it—even if opinions about what counts as “good” vary widely.\n\nIn terms of numbers, analysts predict earnings per share around 41 cents on revenue of about 3.28 billion dollars.\n\nTo sum up, Netflix is riding a wave of strong subscriber growth fueled by compelling content and steady demand—even with price increases. While competition and content changes loom ahead, the company seems poised for continued success this quarter and beyond."}]}

Today, let’s talk about something many of us keep a close eye on: our retirement accounts. Recently, retirement balances, especially in IRAs, have reached record highs. That’s great news, but it also brings up an important question—how can you protect those gains as markets hit these new peaks?\n\nWe’ll explore what it means to have your IRA balance at a record high and discuss some thoughtful ways to safeguard your retirement savings during times like these.\n\nFirst off, when markets climb to new highs, the value of your retirement accounts often grows significantly. This can feel exciting, but it’s also a good moment to pause and consider risk management. Markets can be unpredictable, and a sudden downturn could impact the gains you’ve worked hard to build.\n\nOne common approach is diversification—spreading your investments across different asset types to reduce risk. Another strategy is to review your portfolio and possibly rebalance it, making sure it still aligns with your long-term goals and comfort with risk.\n\nAdditionally, some people look into options like moving part of their investments into more conservative assets or considering strategies that protect against market volatility. The key is finding a balance between growth potential and security.\n\nIn the end, having your IRA at a record high is a positive milestone. But protecting those gains requires attention and sometimes adjustment. Keeping an eye on market conditions and regularly reviewing your retirement plan can help ensure you’re on track for a secure future.\n\nSo, remember: celebrate those gains, but stay thoughtful about how you manage them. That way, your retirement savings can continue working for you no matter what the market does next."}]}

FILE PHOTO -Men exchange greetings in front of an electronic board displaying the Nikkei average outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan January 4, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nEuropean stock futures STXEc1 were flat, suggesting a more subdued opening for the region. DAX futures FDXc1 were up 0.1 percent, and FTSE futures FFIc1 and CAC FCEc1 each up 0.2 percent. \nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was up 0.5 percent, extending record highs set in the previous session. \nU.S. markets were closed for a public holiday on Monday. \nBut Australian shares slipped 0.5 percent, as miners were pressured by weaker Chinese iron ore prices. The materials and mining index .AXMM dropped as much as 0.8 percent, with mining giants BHP Billiton Ltd ( BHP.AX ) and Rio Tinto Ltd ( RIO.AX ) each falling over 1 percent before ending off lows. \nChinese iron ore futures edged up after tumbling 2 percent on Monday, when stockpiles of the steelmaking commodity at China’s ports surged to the highest since at least 2004. [IRONORE/] \nJapan's Nikkei stock index .N225 rallied 1 percent after touching its highest intraday level since November 1991 as the yen's recent surge took a breather, with expectations for strong corporate earnings underpinning sentiment. \n“The yen’s appreciation against the dollar has stopped and this brightened sentiment, along with expectations for robust company quarterly results,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. \nThe euro edged up slightly to $1.2270 EUR= , within sight of its Monday high of $1.2296, its loftiest peak since December 2014. \nThe euro had blipped higher on Monday and German benchmark bond yields hit session highs after European Central Bank rate-setter Ardo Hansson said the central bank could end its bond purchase scheme in one go after September if the economy and inflation develop as expected. \nAdding to the euro’s ascent, data showed the trade surplus in the 19-country euro area rose to its highest level in eight months, indicating companies were so far weathering the impact of a stronger currency. \nThe dollar index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, wallowed at more than three-year lows. It was last at 90.456 .DXY, after dropping as low as 90.279 on Monday, its deepest nadir since December 2014. \nAgainst the yen, the dollar clawed back some lost ground, adding 0.3 percent to 110.82 JPY= . It fell as low as 110.32 yen on Monday, which was its weakest level since Sept. 15. \nJapanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday that he did not see problems with the dollar weakening to around 110.80 yen, but that big swings in currencies would be problematic. \n“The dollar’s problems began last week, when investors sold the dollar on expectations that the Bank of Japan might begin to taper its stimulus,” said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign-exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities. \n“It then continued as the euro rose on suggestions that the ECB would take further normalization steps, showing how sensitive markets are to perceived signals from central banks,” he said. \nCrude oil prices were mixed after rising to their highest levels since December 2014, helped by the dollar’s recent weakness as well as signs that production cuts by OPEC and Russia are tightening supplies. [O/R] \nBrent crude futures LCOc1 were down 30 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $69.96 a barrel after touching a high of $70.37 a barrel on Monday. \nU.S. crude futures CLc1 were up 19 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $64.49 a barrel.

This momentum is partly driven by optimism around corporate earnings and some easing in the Japanese yen’s recent strength. In Japan, the Nikkei index climbed about 1 percent, reaching levels not seen since November 1991. This rally was supported by expectations of solid quarterly results from companies and a pause in the yen’s appreciation against the dollar.\n\nMeanwhile, broader Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan also extended their gains, with the MSCI index rising half a percent. However, not all markets shared this enthusiasm. Australian shares dipped by half a percent, weighed down by weaker prices for iron ore—a key export commodity—especially after stockpiles at Chinese ports surged to record highs. This increase in supply put pressure on mining stocks like BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto.\n\nOver in Europe, the euro has been flirting with its strongest levels in nearly three years, hovering near $1.23. This strength comes amid growing expectations that the European Central Bank might soon scale back its monetary stimulus. Comments from ECB officials suggested the bond purchase program could end as early as after September if economic conditions continue to improve. Supporting this view, data showed the eurozone’s trade surplus hit an eight-month high, signaling resilience despite a stronger currency.\n\nOn the currency front, the U.S. dollar has been relatively weak against a basket of major currencies, marking lows not seen since 2014. Against the yen specifically, the dollar recovered slightly after falling to its weakest point since mid-September. Japanese officials have expressed that while some weakening of the dollar is manageable, large swings in currency values could pose problems.\n\nFinally, oil prices have shown mixed signals. Brent crude recently touched highs last seen in December 2014 but pulled back slightly afterward. U.S. crude futures edged up modestly. These movements reflect a combination of factors including the softer dollar and ongoing supply cuts from OPEC and Russia tightening the market.\n\nIn summary, what we’re seeing is a complex but generally positive picture: Asian shares reaching new highs buoyed by corporate optimism; the euro strengthening on hopes of reduced stimulus; and currencies reacting sensitively to central bank signals—all against a backdrop of cautious commodity price shifts. It’s a reminder of how interconnected economic indicators and policy expectations remain in today’s markets."}]}

FILE PHOTO - People rest near Lima Cathedral with a banner of Pope Francis prior to his visit to Peru from January 18 to 21, in Lima, Peru, January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Mariana Bazo \nPeruvians will watch closely to see if the Argentine pope signals any concern over the pardon after he arrives on Thursday from Chile on the second leg of a South America trip, where corruption and the plight of indigenous people will likely come up. \nPresident Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker, last month narrowly survived an impeachment bid over a graft scandal with the help of Fujimori’s loyalists in Congress, and pardoned Fujimori three days later. \nFujimori, 79, had served less than half of a 25-year sentence for corruption and human rights crimes for commanding death squads to combat a Maoist-inspired insurgency during his 1990-2000 right-wing populist government. \nOpponents of both Fujimori and Kuczynski will be seeking a papal condemnation, even if only in general terms, of human rights abuses and corruption. \n“Hopefully the Pope will show solidarity with the victims,” said human rights activist Gisela Ortiz, whose brother was one of nine university students killed in a massacre of civilians that Fujimori was found guilty of ordering. \nShe called on Francis to meet with her and other family members of Fujimori’s victims. “We want to express how worried we are about the injustice we’re living in,” she said. \nKuczynski, 79, cited medical reasons for granting Fujimori the pardon and has said it was fundamentally about forgiveness. He denies it was part of a backroom deal. \nRosa Rojas, who is also seeking a meeting with the pope, said she still struggles with the loss of her husband and eight-year-old son, who were killed in Fujimori’s battle against the Shining Path rebels. \nCombat between state security forces and the Shining Path and other guerrillas left an estimated 69,000 dead in Peru between 1980 and 2000, with 75 percent of victims comprised of indigenous people, according to Peru’s truth commission. \n“With the pardon, wounds that were healing have reopened,” Rojas said. FILE PHOTO - Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori accompanied by his son Kenji Fujimori leaves the Centenario hospital in Lima, Peru, January 4, 2018. REUTERS/Alexis Pasquel \n‘CORRUPTION IS THE PLAGUE’ \nCardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, hinted strongly that the pope would address corruption during the trip. \nParolin, who ranks only second to the pope in the Church’s hierarchy, told Vatican media that the pope feels fighting corruption is important because “it blocks development and the overcoming of poverty”. \nDuring a previous trip to Latin American Francis said: “Corruption is the plague, it’s the gangrene of society”. \nBut Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said there were no plans for the pope to meet the family members of Fujimori’s victims. \nDespite his downfall, many Peruvians admire Fujimori, crediting him with pacifying Peru, fixing a broken economy and tending to the needs of the poor. Recent polls show that a majority of Peruvians support the pardon. \nHis populist following, led by daughter Keiko and son Kenji, remains one of the country’s most potent political forces. \nFujimori’s supporters are also seeking a gesture of papal understanding for the pardon, but Church sources say that is unlikely. \nHuman rights is expected to come up when Francis visits the Amazonian town of Puerto Maldonado to address increasing risks to the region’s indigenous people - including reclusive tribes that shun contact with outsiders - from rampant wildcat gold mining, illegal logging and drug trafficking. \n“Their territory is increasingly being invaded, their space is becoming smaller and smaller; the livelihoods with which they have survived for so many centuries are being destroyed,” said Father Manuel Jesus Romero. \n“Fishing, hunting, trees and rivers are more and more in danger. Therefore their lives are in danger,” he told the newsletter of REPAM, a Pan-Amazonian Church Network. \nThe South America trip will be 22nd overseas trip of Francis’ pontificate and the sixth to the continent of his birth.

His trip comes at a time when Peru is grappling with the controversial pardon of former president Alberto Fujimori, a decision that has reopened old wounds from a turbulent chapter in the nation’s history.\n\nSo, what’s going on? Alberto Fujimori ruled Peru from 1990 to 2000, a decade marked by both economic reforms and serious human rights abuses. He was convicted and imprisoned for corruption and for ordering death squads during his fight against a Maoist insurgency. Recently, the current president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, pardoned Fujimori on medical grounds, sparking fierce debate. Many Peruvians see Fujimori as a figure who restored order and improved the economy, while others remember the victims of his harsh regime.\n\nThis pardon came shortly after Kuczynski narrowly survived an impeachment attempt tied to corruption allegations, with Fujimori’s political allies playing a crucial role in keeping him in office. This connection has only intensified public outrage, especially among those who suffered under Fujimori’s rule. Families of victims are hoping Pope Francis will acknowledge their pain and speak out against injustice during his visit.\n\nCorruption and human rights abuses are expected to be key themes during the pope’s trip. Vatican officials have hinted that Francis will address corruption as a major barrier to development and poverty reduction—something he has called “the plague” of society before. However, it’s unlikely he will specifically meet with victims’ families during this visit.\n\nBeyond the political controversy, Pope Francis will also focus on the plight of indigenous communities in the Amazon region. These groups face growing threats from illegal mining, logging, and drug trafficking, which endanger their lands and traditional ways of life. The pope’s visit to the Amazonian town of Puerto Maldonado is expected to highlight these challenges and call for greater protection of indigenous peoples.\n\nIn summary, Pope Francis’s visit to Peru is set against a backdrop of political division, historical wounds, and ongoing struggles for justice and environmental protection. His message will likely touch on forgiveness and healing, while also confronting corruption and advocating for vulnerable communities. It’s a moment that underscores how faith and politics often intertwine in complex ways across Latin America today."}]}

Morris 2:57 PM EST \nCoinMarketCap, arguably the most prominent global index of cryptocurrency prices, triggered a wave of anxiety and anger this morning when it removed a group of Korean cryptocurency exchanges from its price calculations. \nThough the change was apparently made at midnight Sunday U.S. EST, CoinMarketCap did not publicize it until midday on Monday, saying that the Korean exchanges showed “extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity.” This morning we excluded some Korean exchanges in price calculations due to the extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity. We are working on better tools to provide users with the averages that are most relevant to them. \n— CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) January 8, 2018 \nThe move resulted in a sharp drop in CoinMarketCap’s measurement of nearly all cryptocurrencies. That gave the impression that a broad market decline , already in progress, had become even more dramatic overnight. As news of the cause for the sharp drop spread Monday, most cryptocurrency prices began recovering losses. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nThe delisting itself seems to have been relatively uncontroversial—as CoinDesk points out , local exchanges can sometimes show sharp divergence from global prices, masking broad trends. According to CoinDesk, the Korean exchanges Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit, which consistently had prices well above the global market, were removed from CoinMarketCap’s calculations. \nRipple’s David Schwartz acknowledged that the new price is “more accurate and meaningful.” They are outliers due to a shortage of cryptos in Korea and difficulty getting KRW out. The new price is more accurate and meaningful, IMO. \n— David Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 8, 2018 \nBut cryptocurrency watchers on Twitter responded with understandable anger to the lateness of CoinMarketCap’s announcement, calling it “unprofessional” and saying it may have triggered panic selling. Do a better job of communicating this type of thing BEFORE you do it! \n— Steven Blanton (@steveruno) January 8, 2018 Well why didn't you let the community know instead surprised many people and the newbies likely sold (luckily us more seasoned investors held and looked for facts of why the dip before making a rash decision) your actions without notice likely caused a loss of money for many! \n— Chris B. (@BaradaranChris) January 8, 2018 \nSome went further, accusing CoinMarketCap of market manipulation. That echoes recent suspicion of insider trading by employees of the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. This was one of the most unprofessional deliberate price manipulation I’ve ever seen smh still Hodl though \n— Mr. Sanchez (@faly_sanchez) January 8, 2018 Cannot find the right words for this really…Either extreme incompetence or pure evil manipulation.Both deserve severe consequences! \n— Pierre Dekkers (@pierre_dekkers) January 8, 2018 \nIf there’s one clear takeaway from the incident, it’s that the infrastructure of cryptocurrency markets, much like cryptocurrencies themselves, is still evolving, unstable, and subject to shocks based on nothing more than avoidable missteps. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into a recent shake-up in the cryptocurrency world that caught many investors off guard. It all started when CoinMarketCap, one of the most widely used sites for tracking crypto prices, suddenly removed several Korean exchanges from its price calculations. This move caused a sharp drop in the reported prices of almost every cryptocurrency, sparking confusion and concern across the market.\n\nSo, what exactly happened? CoinMarketCap quietly made this change around midnight on a Sunday, but didn’t announce it until midday Monday. They explained that these Korean exchanges showed “extreme divergence” in prices compared to the rest of the world, and there was limited opportunity for arbitrage—basically, it was hard to take advantage of price differences between markets. The exchanges affected included major players like Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit, which consistently reported prices well above global averages.\n\nThis adjustment led to a sudden and dramatic dip in cryptocurrency prices as measured by CoinMarketCap. Naturally, this looked like a steep market decline overnight, even though the broader market was already experiencing some downward pressure. Once people learned why the drop happened, prices began to recover.\n\nNot everyone was happy with how CoinMarketCap handled the situation. Many users criticized the site for not informing the community before making such a significant change. Some called it unprofessional and worried that the lack of communication might have caused panic selling, especially among less experienced investors. There were even accusations of market manipulation thrown around, reflecting broader concerns about transparency in crypto markets.\n\nOn the other hand, some industry insiders saw the change as a positive step toward more accurate pricing. For example, Ripple’s David Schwartz pointed out that the new prices are more meaningful because the Korean market faced unique challenges like a shortage of cryptocurrencies and difficulties moving Korean won out of the country.\n\nWhat this episode really highlights is how much cryptocurrency markets are still evolving. The infrastructure supporting these markets remains fragile and can be disrupted by decisions that might have been avoided with better communication and coordination.\n\nIn summary, CoinMarketCap’s removal of certain Korean exchanges from its price index sparked a volatile reaction but also underscored ongoing growing pains in the crypto ecosystem. As these markets mature, transparency and clear communication will be key to maintaining trust and stability for investors everywhere."}]}

Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order aiming to promote access to broadband. Doing so was also a priority for his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton . \nThe rural section of the nationwide infrastructure plan would account for about 25 percent of appropriations, according to the document shared by Axios. The proposal does not give estimates for the federal funding involved in the projects. \nThe plan would aim to address five parts of rural infrastructure: transportation, broadband, water and waste, power and electric, and water resources. The draft says states would be \"incentivized to partner with local and private investment for completion and operation of projects.\" \nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told CNBC that the administration is \"not going to comment on the contents of a leaked document but [looks] forward to presenting our plan in the near future.\" \nThe White House has previously promoted a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. Previous reports indicate it would aim to spur $800 billion in state, local and private spending with $200 billion in federal spending.\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into a glimpse of a proposed infrastructure plan from the Trump administration, focusing especially on rural America. These are the areas that played a big role in the 2016 election, and the plan aims to bring some significant improvements there.\n\nSo, what’s in this plan? According to a leaked draft, it targets five key areas of rural infrastructure: transportation, broadband access, water and waste systems, power and electricity, and water resources. The goal is to make transportation more efficient and expand broadband connectivity, which is crucial for rural communities that often lag behind in internet access.\n\nInterestingly, about a quarter of the total funding for this nationwide infrastructure effort would be dedicated to rural projects. However, the draft doesn’t specify exactly how much federal money will go into these initiatives. Instead, it suggests that states will be encouraged to team up with local governments and private investors to get these projects off the ground and keep them running.\n\nThis isn’t the first time broadband access has been highlighted as a priority. Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at boosting broadband availability in underserved areas—a goal that was also important to his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhile the White House hasn’t officially commented on the leaked details, it has previously promoted a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. Reports suggest this plan would involve $200 billion in federal spending alongside $800 billion coming from state, local, and private sources.\n\nIn short, this proposed plan reflects a focus on improving key infrastructure elements in rural America by encouraging partnerships beyond just federal funding. It aims to enhance transportation and connectivity in ways that could support economic growth and quality of life in these communities. As more details emerge, it will be interesting to see how this vision takes shape and impacts rural regions across the country."}]}

This award highlights his impactful work beyond the silver screen.\n\nIn a conversation with Reuters, Khan shared his thoughts on two important topics. First, he emphasized the need for gender equality in the film industry. He believes that equal representation and opportunities for women in cinema are essential for progress. This reflects a broader conversation happening globally about fairness and inclusivity in storytelling.\n\nSecond, Khan spoke about his involvement with acid attack survivors in India. His work supporting these victims has been both compassionate and influential, helping to bring awareness and change to a serious social issue. The Crystal Award recognizes this dedication to social causes alongside his artistic achievements.\n\nTo sum up, Shah Rukh Khan’s award at Davos is not just about his fame as an actor. It’s a recognition of his commitment to gender equality in film and his meaningful support for acid attack victims.

Today, we’re diving into some recent developments in the U.S. government and how they’ve affected the dollar in the currency markets.\n\nSo, what’s been going on? Over the weekend, the U.S. government entered a shutdown after lawmakers couldn’t agree on funding. This shutdown officially began at midnight on Friday when Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a last-minute funding deal. Naturally, this kind of political gridlock can rattle markets and impact the value of the dollar.\n\nBut then, on Monday, things started to shift. Republican leaders in the Senate managed to gather enough support to move forward with a temporary funding bill—often called a stopgap measure—that would end the shutdown. Shortly after, Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer announced that the government would reopen within a few hours.\n\nHow did the dollar respond to this news? Well, after initially slipping, the dollar trimmed some of its losses against a basket of major currencies. The dollar index, which measures its strength against six key currencies, had dipped earlier but then recovered slightly to 90.39. Meanwhile, against the Japanese yen, the dollar actually strengthened, rising to about 110.96 yen.\n\nIn short, uncertainty around government shutdowns can cause fluctuations in currency markets, but progress toward reopening tends to stabilize things. This recent back-and-forth shows how closely political developments in Washington are watched by traders worldwide.\n\nThat’s a quick look at how a government shutdown and its resolution can influence the dollar’s value. Thanks for listening, and stay tuned for more updates on the intersection of politics and markets."}]}

Today, we’re diving into a recent tennis match that perfectly illustrated the clash between experience and youthful energy at the Auckland Classic.\n\nSo, what happened? Well, David Ferrer, a seasoned pro and four-time champion of this event, faced off against Wu Yibing, an 18-year-old rising star from China. Ferrer, who once ranked as high as third in the world, brought his years of expertise to the court against Wu, who’s the top-ranked junior player globally and last year’s U.S. Open boys’ singles champion.\n\nThe match started off intense. The first set alone stretched to 75 minutes. Wu even had a set point during the tiebreak, leading 6-4. But then, a crucial double fault handed the set to Ferrer. That moment showcased how experience can sometimes tip the scales in tight situations.\n\nIn the second set, Ferrer’s court savvy really came through. He began to tactically outmaneuver Wu, who continued to play aggressively, taking risks that allowed him some opportunities—even breaking Ferrer’s serve when he was close to winning. Still, those moments only delayed what seemed inevitable.\n\nAfter more than two hours on the court, Ferrer secured the victory when Wu hit a forehand long. With this win, Ferrer moved on to face Joao Sousa from Portugal in the next round. Sousa himself had won a tough three-set match earlier in the day.\n\nMeanwhile, other top seeds like Jack Sock and Juan Martin Del Potro received byes into the second round, setting the stage for some exciting matches ahead.\n\nSo, what’s the takeaway here? This match was a clear example of how experience often has the upper hand over raw talent—at least for now—especially in high-pressure moments. But it also highlighted Wu’s potential as a rising star who’s learning to navigate the challenges of professional tennis.\n\nThat’s all for today’s update from Auckland. Stay tuned for more stories from the tennis world coming your way soon."}]}

They’re targeting a 20% increase in silver production, aiming to produce between 5.8 and 6.4 million ounces. Alongside that, they expect to produce 58,000 to 64,000 ounces of gold. When you combine those metals into silver equivalent terms, their goal is between 10.2 and 11.2 million ounces.\n\nTo support this growth, Endeavour plans to invest $48.4 million in capital projects throughout the year. Most of this—about $41.1 million—will go toward sustaining capital at their four operating mines. This investment is higher than the previous year because it includes the development of their new El Compas mine.\n\nSpeaking of El Compas, this will be Endeavour’s fourth mine coming into commercial production, expected to start in the third quarter of 2018 as construction wraps up.\n\nNow, despite this increased production and investment, the company expects cash costs and all-in sustaining costs to actually decline compared to 2017. Specifically, cash costs—after accounting for gold by-product credits—are forecasted to be between $6 and $7 per ounce of silver produced. The all-in sustaining costs, again net of gold credits, are estimated at $15 to $16 per ounce.\n\nWhat’s more, at current metal prices, the operating cash flow should cover these sustaining capital investments throughout the year.

It’s NOT normal,” tweeted actress Jessica Biel.\nBy early Tuesday the initiative, also backed by Eva Longoria and Emma Stone, had raised nearly $14 million of a $15 million target for a legal fund to help victims of sexual harassment in the workplace.\n“We stand with all those who have endured sexual harassment: those who have come forward and those who have decided to remain quiet. It’s time for change, and we must act now,” the group said on their gofundme page.\n“The voices of those affected in every industry have been silenced for too long.”\nThey said harassment often continued because those responsible and employers never faced consequences and because of systematic gender inequality.\n“The struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard and acknowledged in male-dominated workplaces must end; time’s up on this impenetrable monopoly,” they said.\nThe campaign with hashtag #timesup will also push for legislation to penalize companies that tolerate harassment and to discourage the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence victims, according to the New York Times.\n“Time’s up on silence. Time’s up on waiting. Time’s up on tolerating discrimination, harassment or abuse,” Oscar winner Portman wrote on Instagram.\nActors are being encouraged to wear black at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday to protest against sexual harassment.\nEditing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, which covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.

We’re diving into a powerful movement that’s reshaping how we think about workplace harassment and inequality. It’s called Time’s Up, and it’s making waves not just in Hollywood, but across industries everywhere.\n\nSo, what is Time’s Up? It’s a campaign launched by more than 300 people from the entertainment world — actors, writers, directors — all coming together to say enough is enough. They want to fight sexual harassment and abuse at work, especially for women in low-wage jobs who often don’t have the financial security to speak out.\n\nThe campaign took off after the Harvey Weinstein scandal last year, which sparked the #MeToo movement. Time’s Up builds on that momentum with a clear goal: to support victims through a multi-million dollar legal fund aimed at helping people fight harassment cases. By early this year, they had already raised nearly $14 million toward their $15 million goal.\n\nWhat makes Time’s Up stand out is its focus on real change. They’re calling for an end to silence and tolerance of harassment. The group points out that abuse persists because those responsible often face no consequences, and because gender inequality remains deeply entrenched in many workplaces.\n\nThey’re pushing for legislation that holds companies accountable when they ignore harassment, and they want to stop nondisclosure agreements that keep victims quiet. Hollywood stars like Reese Witherspoon, Jessica Chastain, Natalie Portman, Eva Longoria, and Emma Stone have all thrown their weight behind the movement. In fact, actors are encouraged to wear black at the Golden Globe Awards as a visible protest against workplace harassment.\n\nAt its core, Time’s Up is about lifting voices — especially those who’ve been ignored or silenced for too long — and demanding a future where everyone can work without fear of abuse or discrimination.\n\nTo sum it up: Time’s Up is more than just a hashtag or a campaign. It’s a call to action for fairness, respect, and real accountability in every workplace. And it reminds us all that the time for change is now."}]}

We’ll explore the global sales figures reported for 2017 and what they reveal about the drug’s reach.\n\nDarzalex is a medication used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. In 2017, the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson reported the worldwide net sales of this drug. The total net sales for Darzalex that year amounted to approximately 1.24 billion US dollars.\n\nBreaking that down further, sales in the United States made up a significant portion of this total, with about 884 million dollars in net sales. Meanwhile, sales in the rest of the world accounted for around 358 million dollars. This distribution shows that while the US remains the largest market for Darzalex, there is also substantial demand internationally.\n\nIn summary, Darzalex had a strong commercial performance in 2017, crossing the one-billion-dollar mark in global net sales. The data highlights both its importance as a treatment option and its growing presence beyond the US market. Understanding these figures helps us appreciate how cancer therapies are making an impact worldwide."}]}

During that race, Hillary Clinton tried to make an issue out of Barack Obama’s connection to Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam. Farrakhan is a controversial figure, known for his harsh statements about Judaism, which many found deeply offensive.\n\nIn a February debate that year, Clinton pressed Obama to clearly reject Farrakhan’s support. She pointed out that there’s an important difference between simply denouncing someone and outright rejecting their backing. Obama responded carefully, saying he had no formal offer of help from Farrakhan that he needed to reject, but he made it clear he wasn’t accepting any such support.\n\nThis exchange shows how political candidates must navigate endorsements and associations, especially when those endorsements come from divisive figures.

It’s a topic that’s gaining momentum as the country steps up its game in a field often dominated by places like California.\n\nSo, what’s happening in Portugal right now? Lawmakers there have started discussing a draft bill aimed at legalizing medical marijuana. This is a significant step because it signals a shift in policy and public perception around cannabis. Alongside this political development, a major investment is underway—a $20 million cannabis farm has just opened in Portugal. This farm isn’t just any operation; it represents the country’s ambition to become a serious player in the cannabis market.\n\nLet’s break that down. The draft bill on medical marijuana suggests that Portugal is looking to regulate and control cannabis use for health purposes, rather than leaving it in a legal grey area. By legalizing it medically, they can ensure quality standards, patient access, and potentially stimulate economic growth through new industries.\n\nAt the same time, the opening of this large-scale cannabis farm shows practical progress on the ground. With such a substantial investment, Portugal aims to cultivate high-quality cannabis, possibly positioning itself alongside well-known producers like those in California.\n\nTogether, these developments—both legislative and industrial—highlight Portugal’s growing interest in harnessing the benefits of medical cannabis. It’s an example of how countries can approach cannabis policy thoughtfully, balancing regulation with economic opportunity.\n\nIn summary, Portugal is making clear moves toward legalizing medical marijuana and building an industry around it, with lawmakers debating new laws and a major cannabis farm already up and running. It’s an exciting moment that could reshape how the country participates in this global market."}]}

Its 209,480 total calls in 2017 were the most for any year since its founding in 1993. \nLast fall, actress Alyssa Milano of the television show “Charmed” asked women who had been sexually assaulted or harassed to post “Me Too” in response to allegations made against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. \nWeinstein, accused of sexual abuse by dozens of women, has denied having nonconsensual sexual contact with anyone. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the accusations.

REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan \nAt the national hotline’s call center, the lights that workers flip on to indicate they are on the phone never seemed to turn off, said Celia Gamboa, a manager at the national hotline. The chat app most callers prefer was flooded with messages, she said. The #MeToo movement almost always came up. \n“It wasn’t just a one-time thing,” Gamboa said. “We’re just going to continue to see that type of flow into the future.” Slideshow (2 Images) \nRAINN added 40 employees to its staff of 200 and stepped up volunteer recruiting, said CEO Scott Berkowitz. That has helped chip away at the wait times, he said. \nElsewhere, Network for Victim Recovery of D.C. saw a spike in calls about sexual harassment. Executive Director Bridgette Stumpf said that unfortunately, the center can often only recommend private attorneys for people whose harassment did not include violence, adding such help may be too expensive for many victims. \nThe DC Rape Crisis Center now sees an average of 70 people a week seeking legal, physical or psychological help, up from 30 to 40 before #MeToo, said Executive Director Indira Henard. It also saw a bump in donations last fall following the #MeToo postings. \n“It is for the record books,” Henard said. “I don’t believe there has ever been a time in our history when we talked about sexual violence and its impact this way.” Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Scott Malone and David Gregorio\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s episode. We’re diving into how the #MeToo movement has sparked a significant increase in calls to sexual assault hotlines across the United States. It’s a powerful example of how social movements can encourage people to seek help and share their experiences.\n\nSo, what’s been happening? Since the #MeToo movement gained momentum last fall, starting with actress Alyssa Milano’s call for survivors to post “Me Too” in response to allegations against Harvey Weinstein, sexual assault hotlines have seen record-breaking activity. The National Sexual Assault Hotline, run by the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network—or RAINN—experienced a sharp rise in calls. In November 2017, calls jumped 25 percent compared to the previous year, and then another 30 percent in December. In total, RAINN handled over 209,000 calls that year, the highest since its founding in 1993.\n\nAt the hotline’s call center, staff noticed something remarkable. Lights indicating active calls rarely went off, and their chat app was flooded with messages. Many callers directly referenced the #MeToo movement. One manager described this surge not as a one-time event but as an ongoing wave of people reaching out for support.\n\nTo meet the demand, RAINN added 40 new employees to their team of 200 and increased volunteer recruitment. These efforts helped reduce wait times, which at one point stretched up to three hours on the busiest days.\n\nThis trend wasn’t limited to RAINN. Other organizations, like the Network for Victim Recovery of D.C., also reported more calls about sexual harassment. However, they face challenges too—especially when harassment doesn’t involve violence—because legal help can be costly and hard to access for many survivors.\n\nMeanwhile, the DC Rape Crisis Center saw weekly visits nearly double after #MeToo started trending, with more people seeking legal advice, physical care, and counseling. They also experienced an increase in donations following the movement’s rise.\n\nWhat stands out here is how #MeToo has opened up a national conversation about sexual violence like never before. People who might have stayed silent are now finding the courage to speak out and get help.\n\nIn summary, the #MeToo movement has not only raised awareness but has also led to a significant increase in support-seeking behavior among survivors of sexual assault and harassment. Organizations are working hard to keep up with this surge, showing both the power and the challenges of such a widespread social awakening.\n\nThanks for listening today. If you or someone you know needs support, remember that help is available—and reaching out can be a crucial first step."}]}

[EIA/S] \nThe market was also bolstered modestly by data showing a sharp decline in U.S. production last week that analysts say could have been the result of extreme cold temperatures across the United States to start the year. \n“The lower draw in crude oil stocks, combined with the strong builds in product stocks is bearish news for prices. But market participants could also use the sharp drop in production as an excuse to buy,” said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, Germany. \nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $63.33 a barrel, up 37 cents, at 12:55 p.m. EST (1755 GMT). Earlier in the session, prices hit $63.67, their highest since Dec. 9, 2014. \nBrent crude futures were at $68.96 a barrel, 14 cents above their last close. The global benchmark earlier hit $69.37, its highest since May 2015. \nA broad, global market rally, including stocks, has also been fueling investment into crude oil futures. [MKTS/GLOB] A gas station attendant pumps fuel into a customer's car at PetroChina's petrol station in Beijing, China, March 21, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nThe oil market has been buoyant in the last several weeks, with U.S. crude futures at highs not seen since late 2014, and Brent crude less than $1 per barrel away from a milestone that would, too, be a high point since that same time. \nOil prices have risen more than 13 percent since early December, and there are indications of overheating. Analysts warned that the market is ignoring U.S. production increases at its peril. \nThe rally has brought out some concerns that the market could overheat, especially as U.S. production is expected to rise to new records later in the year. \nOn Tuesday, the EIA boosted its expectations for production in coming months, and now sees overall production at record highs, surpassing 11 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2019. \nU.S. crude oil production is expected to hit 10 million bpd next month, leaving only Russia and Saudi Arabia at higher levels. \nMembers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fear current price gains could prompt U.S. shale oil companies to flood the market. OPEC, along with non-members including Russia, cut supply by 1.8 million bpd in a late 2016 agreement that has been extended through the end of this year. \nThe cuts were aimed at reducing a global supply overhang that had dogged oil markets since 2014.

Let’s talk about the recent movements in crude oil prices and what’s driving them.\n\nOver the past week, U.S. crude oil inventories dropped by nearly 5 million barrels, which was a bigger decline than many experts expected. That kind of drawdown usually supports higher oil prices. But at the same time, gasoline and fuel stocks actually increased more than anticipated, which balanced things out and put some pressure on prices.\n\nAdding another layer to the story, U.S. oil production took a noticeable dip last week. Analysts suggest this could be linked to the extreme cold weather that hit much of the country early in the year. So while less production might encourage investors to buy on the assumption that supply is tightening, the overall picture remains a bit mixed.\n\nLooking at prices, U.S. crude futures rose to over $63 a barrel, nearing levels not seen since late 2014. Brent crude, the global benchmark, also climbed close to its highest point since mid-2015. This rally has been supported not just by supply and demand factors but also by a broader surge in global markets that’s driving investment into oil futures.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns about whether this rally might be overheating. Prices have jumped more than 13 percent since early December, and some analysts warn that the market might be overlooking rising U.S. production. In fact, forecasts show that U.S. crude output is expected to hit record highs soon—potentially surpassing 11 million barrels per day by next year—making the U.S. one of the top producers worldwide.\n\nThis expected increase worries members of OPEC and their allies, who have been cutting supply since late 2016 to reduce a global glut and support prices. They fear that higher prices could encourage U.S. shale producers to ramp up output even more, which could flood the market and undermine these efforts.\n\nSo, while oil prices are currently strong, the balance between rising U.S. production and efforts to limit supply globally will be key to watch in the coming months.\n\nIn summary, recent inventory drops and production dips have pushed oil prices higher, but growing U.S. output and rising fuel stocks add caution to the picture. The market is navigating between these opposing forces as it looks ahead to what’s next for crude oil.\n\nThanks for tuning in—stay with us for more updates on energy markets."}]}

Microsoft jumped up by one spot to take third place, while electric-car company Tesla fell from No. 3 to sixth place. Retail giant Amazon climbed from fifth place to fourth place, and Netflix , which made the top 10 in 2017, fell to No. 13.\nIn the most recent report, two new companies managed to push their way into the top 10: ride-hailing app Uber and e-commerce site Alibaba .\nGeographically, North America produced the most innovative companies, with 27 featured on the list. Europe produced 16 entrants, up from 10 last year.\nThe travel and transportation sector also expanded its showing on the 2018 list, with companies such as Uber, Tesla , SpaceX and Airbnb included.\nThe firm found that the most innovative companies have been fueled by digital technologies. For example, they prioritize mobile products, digital design, big data and also quickly adapt to technological advances. They also tend to develop and test new products faster and more cheaply than other companies.\nAccording to the research, the biggest difference between the most innovative companies and the companies that appear much lower on the list is how heavily they have incorporated these digital processes into their businesses.\n\"While 79 percent of strong innovators reported that they had properly digitized innovation processes, only 29 percent of weak innovators make the same claim,\" the study reports.\nDrew Angerer | Getty Images Last year, the most innovative companies were those that brought in new ideas from outside sources such as social media and had open and collaborative work environments.\nFinally, the research notes that business leaders at the most innovative companies do five key things that set them apart from their competition:\n1. Leaders dedicate resources: They realize the importance of digital and invest accordingly.\n2. Leaders invest in speed: They test ideas earlier and launch products quickly.\n3. Leaders take smart risks: They make big bets that are high-risk but also high-reward.\n4. Leaders invest in data: They mine and analyze data to glean insight for their products.\n5.

We’ll explore which companies are leading the charge, what sets them apart, and the key strategies their leaders use to stay ahead.\n\nFor the second year running, Apple and Google have claimed the top spots as the most innovative companies. Right behind them, Microsoft moved up to third place, while Tesla dropped a bit from third to sixth. Amazon climbed from fifth to fourth, and Netflix slipped out of the top ten to number thirteen. Notably, two newcomers broke into the top ten: Uber, known for ride-hailing, and Alibaba, a giant in e-commerce.\n\nWhen we look at where these innovators are based, North America leads with 27 companies on the list. Europe is catching up, increasing its presence from 10 to 16 companies. The travel and transportation sector is also growing stronger, with big names like Uber, Tesla, SpaceX, and Airbnb making an impact.\n\nSo what’s driving this innovation? It turns out digital technology is at the heart of it all. The most innovative companies focus heavily on mobile products, digital design, big data, and quickly adapting to new technologies. They’re also faster and more cost-effective when it comes to developing and testing new products.\n\nA big difference between top innovators and those further down the list is how deeply they integrate digital processes into their business. Nearly 80 percent of strong innovators say they’ve properly digitized their innovation efforts, compared to less than 30 percent of weaker performers.\n\nLeaders at these top companies don’t just talk about innovation—they put resources behind it. They invest in speed by testing ideas early and launching products quickly. They take smart risks that might be high-stakes but offer big rewards. Data plays a huge role too; these leaders analyze it closely to guide product development. And finally, they focus on securing top talent across the company.\n\nTo sum up, being a leader in innovation today means embracing digital tools deeply, acting quickly on new ideas, taking calculated risks, using data wisely, and building a talented team. Companies that do all this well continue to rise at the top of the innovation game.\n\nThanks for joining me today as we unpacked what sets the most innovative companies apart. Until next time!"}]}

This concept, made popular by Larry Summers during the Obama years, suggested that the U.S. economy was destined for persistently slow growth. It was a way to explain the sluggish economic performance at the time, almost like an inevitable fate.\n\nSummers argued that because of this slow growth, the government should step in and borrow more money to invest in public projects. Essentially, it was a call for more spending to jumpstart the economy.\n\nBut now, a year after those Obama-era economists have moved on, the picture is starting to change. Recent data from the Commerce Department suggests that the economy might not be stuck in this slow-growth trap after all.\n\nSo, what does this mean? The idea that America’s growth is doomed to be slow — this secular stagnation — might be more of a passing phase than a permanent condition. The evidence is pointing towards a more dynamic economic future, rather than one defined by chronic sluggishness.\n\nIn short, the theory of secular stagnation, once a popular explanation for slow growth, seems to be losing its grip as new data challenges its assumptions. It reminds us that economic trends can shift, and what looks inevitable today might look very different tomorrow."}]}

This case has seen some important developments in the Nevada District Court that are worth understanding.\n\nSo, what’s the situation? Reading International has been dealing with a derivative lawsuit brought by James Cotter Jr., a former CEO and president of the company. Derivative lawsuits usually involve shareholders suing on behalf of the company, often targeting directors or officers for alleged mismanagement or wrongdoing.\n\nHere’s what happened: On December 28th, a judge dismissed claims against five of Reading International’s directors in this lawsuit. The very next day, those same directors, who were cleared of the claims, voted to ratify the termination of James Cotter Jr. as CEO and president back in 2015. This suggests that the board stood by their earlier decision to let Cotter go.\n\nAnother key point from the court’s ruling was related to Patton Vision LLC, an entity that showed interest in acquiring outstanding stock of Reading International. The court dismissed some derivative claims based on this indication of interest, which could be significant for the company’s future ownership or control.\n\nHowever, not all claims were resolved. Some remaining allegations in the Cotter Jr. derivative litigation have been scheduled for trial starting January 8, 2018. So, while some parts of the case have been dismissed, other issues are still up for decision.\n\nTo sum it up, Reading International has seen partial victories in this legal battle with several directors cleared of claims and their past decisions reaffirmed. But the story isn’t over yet, as upcoming trials will address unresolved matters in this ongoing derivative lawsuit. It’s a reminder of how complex corporate legal disputes can be and how they often unfold over extended periods."}]}

REUTERS/Norihiko Shirouzu/Files The reading suggested surprising resilience in the world’s second-largest economy at the end of the year, though it was somewhat at odds with a much larger official survey on Sunday that pointed to a slight loss of momentum.\nThe Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 last month, from 50.8 in November, and far outpacing economists’ expectations for a slight dip to 50.6.\nThe 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.\nAnalysts have expected some softening in China’s manufacturing activity as a punishing crackdown on air pollution, a cooling property market and higher borrowing costs all start to weigh on the world’s second-largest economy.\nThat view appeared to be borne out by the official data at the weekend which suggested that production expanded in December at a slightly more modest pace.\nBut Caixin’s findings showed output grew at the fastest pace in three months, bolstered by improving demand.\nTotal new orders at home and from abroad rose at the strongest pace since August, with the sub-index jumping to 53.0 in December from 51.8 the previous month.\nThe Caixin survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms which are believed to be more export-oriented.\nWhile the official data pointed to a wobble in production, it also showed a pickup in overseas orders which should help support China’s exporters in the next few months.\nPRICE PRESSURES However, despite the increase in new work, the Caixin survey indicated manufacturers continued to shed staff in December and input costs continued to rise sharply, largely due to higher prices for raw materials.\nCompanies were able to pass on some of those cost increases to customers, suggesting broader inflationary pressures may intensify in China this year. The official data pointed to even stronger price rises.\nChina’s vast industrial sector has reported strong earnings growth this year thanks to a year-long construction boom that has fuelled demand and prices for building materials.\nBut government measures to tame rising housing prices and high debt levels are starting to weigh on property investment, while the boost from a massive infrastructure spree is starting to fade.\nBeijing’s war on winter smog has also disrupted manufacturing activity.\nSome steel mills, smelters and factories in the north have been forced to curtail or halt production, though plants in other parts of the country may be ramping up production to fill the shortfall and gain more market share.\nDespite the pickups in output and new orders, however, the Caixin survey showed business confidence in the 12-month outlook remained weak by historical standards. Respondents cited forecasts of relatively subdued client demand and changes to national policies, though no more details were provided.\n“Manufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,” Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin release.\n”However, we should not underestimate downward pressure on growth due to tightening monetary policy and strengthening oversight on local government financing.”\nAnalysts have widely expected China will report slightly cooler economic growth in the fourth quarter after a forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion in the first nine months of the year, supported by the construction boom and robust exports.\nSources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as last year, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilising build-up of debt.\nReporting by Lusha Zhang and Elias Glenn; Editing by Kim Coghill\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s episode. We’re diving into some fresh insights about China’s manufacturing sector and what recent data tells us about the state of its economy as we closed out last year.\n\nSo, here’s the big picture: In December, China’s manufacturing activity actually picked up, hitting a four-month high. This was a bit unexpected because many analysts had been predicting a slowdown. We’ll explore what’s driving this resilience and what it might mean moving forward.\n\nLet’s break it down. A private survey focusing on small and mid-sized manufacturers showed the manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index, or PMI, rose to 51.5 in December from 50.8 in November. Now, the PMI is a key indicator—anything above 50 means the sector is expanding, while below 50 signals contraction. So this uptick suggests more factories ramped up production, responding to a surge in new orders from both domestic and international customers.\n\nInterestingly, this finding contrasts with a larger official survey released just days earlier, which indicated only modest growth and hinted at some loss of momentum. The difference may come down to the types of companies surveyed; the private index tends to capture smaller exporters who might be more sensitive to global demand shifts.\n\nDespite the growth in output and orders, manufacturers continued to reduce their workforce in December. At the same time, input costs rose sharply—mostly because raw material prices increased. Companies managed to pass some of these higher costs onto customers, pointing to rising inflation pressures within the manufacturing sector.\n\nNow, why all this matters: China’s industrial gains this year have largely been fueled by a booming construction sector and strong demand for building materials. But that momentum is facing headwinds. Government efforts to cool housing prices and reduce debt are starting to slow property investment. Plus, Beijing’s crackdown on winter pollution has forced some factories in northern regions to cut back or halt production temporarily.\n\nStill, even with these challenges, some plants elsewhere are stepping up production to fill gaps and capture more market share. However, business confidence looking ahead remains cautious. Manufacturers are wary about subdued client demand and potential policy changes that could impact growth.\n\nExperts suggest that while manufacturing conditions improved at the end of last year—indicating some economic stabilization—there are ongoing pressures from tighter monetary policies and increased oversight on local government financing.\n\nLooking ahead, China’s leaders seem poised to maintain their growth target around 6.5 percent for 2018, aiming to balance steady expansion with efforts to prevent financial risks.\n\nTo sum up: Despite various challenges—from environmental regulations to rising costs—China’s manufacturing sector showed surprising strength as 2017 closed out, driven by higher production and new orders. But cautious optimism prevails as companies navigate inflation pressures and policy uncertainties in the months ahead.\n\nThanks for listening. Stay tuned for more updates on global economic trends next time."}]}

A firefighter walks out of a burnt hospital in Miryang, South Korea, January 26, 2018. Kim Dong-min/Yonhap via REUTERS \nMost of those who died were on the first and second floors, said Choi, but added that there were no deaths from burns. \nSeven people were critically injured, while 126 had less serious wounds, officials told a Friday evening briefing. \nThe injured were treated at 14 regional hospitals. \nBy Friday afternoon, police had cordoned off the burnt-out hospital, as forensic investigators combed the smoke-blackened building. Charred debris and shattered glass littered the ground outside. NO SPRINKLER SYSTEM \nAsia’s fourth-largest economy, with one of the world’s fastest ageing populations, South Korea has faced criticism in recent years over inadequate safety standards. Slideshow (5 Images) \nSong said the six-storey hospital did not have a sprinkler system and was not large enough to require one under the law. \nThe nursing home annexe, where no patients died, is covered by a new law, however, and Song said the hospital had planned to begin installing a sprinkler system there next week. \nHealth Minister Park Neung-hoo said the government would consider changing the law. \nInterior ministry guidelines published in December 2016 suggest sprinklers for all buildings of six or more storeys. \nOfficials said they were still investigating the cause of the fire, but were looking at a possible short circuit in the emergency room’s heating and cooling system. \n“According to an initial eyewitness, fire broke out where there are two air-conditioning and heating devices in the emergency room,” Song said. \n“Others said an electric spark occurred on the ceiling of the emergency room and then fire spread quickly.” \nThe hospital had regular safety inspections and was built to government standards, with fire exits and extinguishers, many of which were used during the fire, he added. \nPresident Moon Jae-in held an emergency meeting with top aides and urged “all necessary measures” to help survivors. \nInterior Minister Kim Boo-kyum, who visited Miryang to apologise for the fire, promised government help for victims, Yonhap news agency said. \nIn December, 29 people were killed in a blaze at an eight-storey fitness centre in Jecheon City, most of them women trapped in a sauna by toxic fumes. The event fed anger over reports of shoddy construction, among other shortcomings. \nIn 2014, a fire at a rural hospital killed 21 people, while a 2008 warehouse fire outside Seoul killed 40.

The blaze started early in the morning, around 7:30 a.m., near the emergency room on the hospital’s first floor. Unfortunately, this was the main exit area, which quickly became engulfed in flames and thick, toxic smoke.\n\nAt least 37 people lost their lives, and more than 140 were injured. Many of the victims were elderly patients, with ages ranging widely but many over 70. Those who could fled through windows using ladders and plastic escape slides. Some patients had to be carried out by firefighters because they couldn’t walk on their own. One witness described helping elderly patients scramble out through windows as the fire raged.\n\nThe hospital was six stories tall but did not have a sprinkler system. According to the hospital director, current laws did not require sprinklers for buildings of this size. However, there are guidelines suggesting sprinklers for buildings six stories or taller, and the hospital had planned to install them in an adjacent nursing home next week. This gap in regulation has sparked calls for change from government officials.\n\nInvestigators believe the fire might have been caused by a short circuit in the heating and cooling system within the emergency room. The hospital had regular safety inspections and was equipped with fire exits and extinguishers, many of which were used during the evacuation.\n\nThis tragedy comes less than a month after another deadly fire in South Korea and adds to growing concerns about building safety and aging infrastructure in a country with one of the world’s fastest aging populations.\n\nIn response, President Moon Jae-in held an emergency meeting urging all necessary support for survivors, while officials promised to review safety laws to prevent future disasters.\n\nSo, what stands out here is how this heartbreaking event highlights vulnerabilities in safety regulations—especially in places meant to protect our most vulnerable—and how urgent it is to address these gaps before more lives are lost.\n\nThanks for listening."}]}

The range is lower than 98.5 million pounds reported last year.\nShares of the company were down 21 percent at 222.8 pence at 0846 GMT, making them the top drag on the FTSE Mid Cap index.\nThe retailer, which sells most of its products for under a pound, said like-for-like sales in the Christmas trading period were driven by lower margin non-card categories, such as gifts and dressings.\nThe company said profit would be hurt by previously flagged pressure from a weaker pound, as about half of the company’s annual costs of its goods come from products sourced in U.S. dollars, and higher costs for wages.\nBritain’s finance minister in 2016 raised the minimum wage to 7.50 pounds from 7.20 pounds.\nThe company said it expects the combined impact of foreign exchange and wage inflation to result in 7 million to 8 million pounds of additional costs in 2019\n“...whilst we have plans to mitigate this impact as far as possible, we recognise that against this backdrop, any EBITDA growth for the year is likely to be limited,” its Chief Executive Karen Hubbard said on Thursday.

If you’ve ever picked up a card or gift from one of their stores, you might find this story especially interesting.\n\nCard Factory, which has been publicly traded since 2014, recently forecasted lower core earnings for 2017. Specifically, they expect their underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization—known as EBITDA—to fall between 93 and 95 million pounds. That’s down from 98.5 million pounds the previous year. This announcement sent their shares tumbling by 21 percent early in the trading day, making them the biggest drag on the FTSE Mid Cap index.\n\nSo, what’s behind this dip in earnings? One key factor is tighter profit margins. While Card Factory is known for selling most of its products for under a pound, their Christmas sales were actually driven more by non-card items like gifts and dressings. These categories tend to have lower profit margins, which put pressure on overall profitability.\n\nAnother significant challenge comes from rising costs. About half of Card Factory’s goods are sourced in U.S. dollars, so the weaker British pound has made these imports more expensive. On top of that, wage costs have gone up due to an increase in the UK’s minimum wage—from £7.20 to £7.50 per hour in 2016—which adds millions to their annual expenses.\n\nThe company estimates that these combined factors—currency fluctuations and wage inflation—will add between £7 million and £8 million in costs in 2019. Despite efforts to counteract these pressures, Card Factory’s CEO Karen Hubbard acknowledges that any growth in EBITDA for the year will likely be limited.\n\nIn summary, Card Factory’s recent outlook highlights how external factors like currency shifts and wage increases can squeeze retail margins, even for businesses with popular products and steady sales. It’s a reminder of the complex challenges retailers face behind the scenes as they try to balance costs and keep customers coming back."}]}

Shares in Bioverativ leaped 63 percent in early U.S. trading and Juno jumped 27 percent, while Sanofi fell 4 percent and Celgene 1.5 percent on news of the deals. \n“The signs are good for biotech deal activity in 2018,” said Chris Stirling, head of KPMG’s global life sciences practice. \nBig companies are under pressure from declining sales of older treatments and many are struggling to find sufficient high-value replacements from within their own laboratories, making buying in products and know-how an attractive option. \n“It takes a long time to introduce technology that makes a significant difference, and in the interim CEOs are looking at any way to get their hands on product where they believe they can make a decent return,” Stirling said. “They’ve got to be seen to be doing things, otherwise they really struggle to convince investors.” \nBoth Sanofi and Celgene had been seen as likely multibillion-dollar acquirers. BUSY START FILE PHOTO: A scientist prepares protein samples for analysis in a lab at the Institute of Cancer Research in Sutton, Britain, July 15, 2013. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo \nThe French group, which faces mounting competition in its key diabetes unit, lost out on buying U.S. cancer firm Medivation to Pfizer in 2016, and also missed acquiring Swiss-based Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson last year. \nCelgene, meanwhile, needs to dilute its reliance on cancer drug Revlimid. It had been widely tipped as a buyer for Juno, whose technology is at the cutting edge of cancer treatment. \nJuno is one of several pioneers of a system to modify immune cells to fight tumors and its JCAR017 product is likely to reach the market in 2019, behind rival approval treatments from Novartis and Gilead. FILE PHOTO:A scientist prepares protein samples for analysis in a lab at the Institute of Cancer Research in Sutton, July 15, 2013. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo. \nGilead only recently jumped into the space after acquiring Kite Pharma last year for $12 billion in one of the few standout deals during a relatively subdued year for biotech M&A. \nDespite the late start, Celgene believes JCAR017 could have peak annual sales of $3 billion and it sees the acquisition being “incrementally additive” to net product sales in 2020. Following setbacks at Juno, Celgene is paying less than the $93 a share it stumped up for just under 10 percent of the company in 2015. \nSanofi expects Bioverativ, which was spun off from Biogen last year, can deliver commercial success despite rapid changes in the $10 billion hemophilia market posed by a novel drug from Roche and the potential of gene therapy to provide a one-time cure. \nThose changes have spooked some investors but Sanofi is betting that the factor replacement therapies made by Bioverativ will remain the standard of care for many years and it expects the deal to boost earnings immediately. \nMonday’s two big acquisitions build on an already busy start for 2018 biotech M&A, with Celgene earlier agreeing to acquire privately-held Impact Biomedicines for as much as $7 billion, including $1.1 billion upfront, and Novo Nordisk bidding $3.1 billion for Belgium’s Ablynx. \nSeparate reports this month by consultancy EY and law firm Baker McKenzie both predicted a significant rise in life sciences M&A in 2018, helped by U.S. tax changes that may lift big companies’ appetite for deals. \nLazard advised Sanofi on its deal, while Guggenheim Securities and J.P. Morgan worked for Bioverativ. J.P. Morgan also worked for Celgene and Morgan Stanley for Juno.

Two big players, Sanofi and Celgene, made headlines by spending over $20 billion combined to bolster their drug portfolios, focusing on treatments for hemophilia and cancer.\n\nSo, what’s behind these massive deals? Simply put, big pharmaceutical companies are feeling pressure. Many of their older drugs are losing steam in the market, and developing new blockbuster treatments from scratch takes a long time. To keep growing and satisfy investors, these companies are turning to acquisitions—buying promising products and expertise from smaller biotech firms.\n\nSanofi agreed to buy Bioverativ, a U.S. company specializing in hemophilia treatments, for $11.6 billion. This is Sanofi’s largest deal in seven years and a strategic move as it faces stiff competition in its diabetes business. Meanwhile, Celgene is purchasing the remaining 90 percent of Juno Therapeutics for about $9 billion. Juno is known for cutting-edge cancer therapies that modify immune cells to attack tumors—a rapidly advancing area in cancer treatment.\n\nThese deals caused significant market reactions. Shares of Bioverativ soared 63 percent after the announcement, while Juno’s shares rose 27 percent. On the flip side, Sanofi and Celgene’s stocks dipped slightly as investors digested the news.\n\nBoth companies see these acquisitions as essential steps to maintain momentum. Sanofi believes Bioverativ’s hemophilia therapies will remain a standard treatment despite emerging gene therapies and new drugs from competitors. Celgene hopes Juno’s innovative cancer therapies will diversify its portfolio beyond its reliance on one major drug and expects the acquisition to add significantly to its sales by 2020.\n\nThese deals are part of a broader trend expected to continue throughout 2018. Other acquisitions earlier in the year include Celgene’s purchase of Impact Biomedicines and Novo Nordisk’s bid for Ablynx. Industry experts also predict that changes in U.S. tax laws could further encourage big pharma companies to pursue more deals.\n\nIn summary, the biotech sector is heating up with strategic acquisitions as large drugmakers seek new growth avenues amid challenges with existing products. By snapping up innovative smaller firms, they aim to stay competitive and deliver fresh treatments for patients worldwide."}]}

CHINESE DEAL, JOB CUTS \nIn response, Carrefour announced a preliminary deal with Internet giant Tencent ( 0700.HK ) and local retailer Yonghui regarding a potential investment stake in Carrefour China. Carrefour will remain the largest shareholder of Carrefour China. \nA weak performance in France, which accounts for 47 percent of Carrefour’s sales and 44 percent of operating profit and where struggling hypermarkets still dominate, has weighed on group profitability and hampered the performance of its shares. \nCarrefour unveiled plans to cut costs by 2 billion euros on a full year basis by 2020, simplify its organization and store network, and accelerate its expansion into convenience stores. \nCarrefour added that a voluntary redundancy plan would be offered to 2,400 employees at its head office in France, out of total workforce of 10,500. \nCarrefour is the largest private sector employer in France, with 115,000 French staff out of a global workforce of 384,000. \nThe job cuts threaten to put Bompard on a collision course with powerful French unions, such as Force Ouvriere, which has already called for a day of protests on Feb. 8. \nBompard unveiled the plan after Carrefour said last week that its 2017 operating profit could fall by 15 percent amid weak sales. This marked its second profit warning in six months. \n($1 = 0.8165 euros)\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into the recent changes at Carrefour, one of the world’s biggest retailers, as it navigates a rapidly shifting retail landscape. We’ll explore how new leadership is tackling challenges at home and abroad, with a clear focus on digital growth and cost-cutting.\n\nCarrefour’s new CEO, Alexandre Bompard, took charge in July with a big task ahead. The company has been losing ground in its home market, France, especially against rivals like Leclerc. At the same time, Carrefour is facing stiff competition from online giants like Amazon, which has been making moves into food retail and could soon target Europe more aggressively.\n\nTo respond, Carrefour plans to significantly ramp up its investment in e-commerce. By 2022, it aims to spend 2.8 billion euros—about six times its current level—to boost its online presence. This is a major shift for a company that was relatively slow to invest in digital platforms.\n\nIn China, Carrefour has struggled for years amid fierce local competition and a booming online market. To strengthen its position there, Carrefour recently announced a preliminary deal with Tencent, the internet giant, and local retailer Yonghui. This deal would bring in local investors while allowing Carrefour to remain the largest shareholder in its Chinese operations.\n\nBack in France, where nearly half of Carrefour’s sales and profits come from, the company faces ongoing challenges. Traditional hypermarkets are struggling, which has hurt profitability and share performance. To address this, Carrefour plans to cut costs by 2 billion euros annually by 2020. This includes simplifying its store network and organization, expanding convenience stores, and offering voluntary redundancy to 2,400 employees at its French headquarters.\n\nThese job cuts highlight the tough balancing act Bompard faces—not just improving business performance but also managing relations with powerful French unions that have already planned protests.\n\nAll these moves come after Carrefour warned that its operating profit for 2017 could drop by 15 percent due to weak sales—marking the second profit warning in just six months.\n\nIn summary, Carrefour is undergoing significant change under new leadership—cutting costs at home while making bold investments to catch up in e-commerce and strengthen its position in China. It’s a clear example of how even retail giants must adapt quickly to stay competitive in today’s market."}]}

The is set to encourage foreign purchases of non-prime category steel. [ bit.ly/2DRagUO ]\nThe news comes after India imposed anti-dumping duty on several stainless steel and flat steel products from China, the United States, South Korea and the European Union, to curb the influx of cheaper imports and help local producers.\nReporting by Aditi Shah\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about a recent change in India’s steel import policy that could have a big impact on the market. Specifically, India has expanded the number of ports authorized to handle imports of non-prime steel. \n\nSo, what’s going on here? The Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry recently announced that three additional ports are now open for importing all types of steel, including non-prime grades. This brings the total number of such ports to six. By allowing more entry points for steel imports, India is making it easier for buyers to bring in non-prime steel from abroad.\n\nNow, why is this significant? Earlier, India had imposed anti-dumping duties on certain stainless steel and flat steel products coming from countries like China, the U.S., South Korea, and the EU. These duties were meant to protect local producers by limiting cheaper imports flooding the market. But at the same time, expanding the number of ports for non-prime steel imports suggests a move to encourage foreign purchases in that category.\n\nIn other words, while India is guarding against unfairly low-priced steel in some segments, it is simultaneously opening up more avenues for importing non-prime steel. This could offer more flexibility and options for buyers who need these types of steel products.\n\nTo sum up, India’s decision to add three new ports for importing all kinds of steel, including non-prime varieties, reflects a balancing act. The country is protecting its domestic industry from dumping in some areas while also promoting imports where it sees fit. It’s a noteworthy development in the ongoing story of how nations manage trade and industry priorities."}]}

These larger ships typically transport massive loads of around 150,000 tonnes, including iron ore and coal. Their index dropped by 48 points, or 3.22 percent, down to 1,445 points. Just last week, capesize rates fell sharply—about 35 percent—the biggest weekly drop in two years. Their daily earnings also slipped by $113 to roughly $11,458.\n\nSmaller vessel segments showed modest gains as well. The supramax index edged up 2 points to 913, and the handysize index rose by 1 point to 585.\n\nSo overall, while the Baltic Exchange’s main index bounced back slightly thanks to stronger panamax rates, the gains were limited because capesize rates continued to fall. It’s a reminder of how varied conditions can be across different ship sizes in the dry bulk market.\n\nTo sum it up: after a rough stretch, we’re seeing a modest recovery in some shipping segments but ongoing challenges in others—especially for those big capesize vessels carrying heavy cargoes.\n\nThat’s all for today’s freight market snapshot.

That means only the designated owner will be able to create reminders, send text messages, and get calendar notifications from the built-in Siri, according to online news and entertainment site. \nAdditionally, the report said Siri will only call out notifications, including text messages and calendar appointments, when that owner is on the same network as the HomePod. When he or she is away from the network, Siri will not report that someone texted. \nApple unveiled its HomePod last year and pitched it first and foremost as a smart speaker that would deliver far better sound than some of its competitors, including the Amazon Echo and Google Home. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nHowever, the HomePod is also powered by Apple’s virtual personal assistant Siri, allowing users to control smart home gadgets like lights and thermostats. According to Refinery29, Siri will also be able to create and alert users to reminders and read aloud text messages—features that could help folks stay abreast of what’s happening without ever needing to pick up their iPhones. \nWhile HomePod owners will likely find value in Siri not calling out the content of text messages when they’re not home for privacy’s sake, it’s unclear how HomePod would work in a family setting. For instance, some families might have multiple iCloud accounts and in some settings, they might want text messages and calendar information from one iCloud account shared and in other settings, have other iCloud information beaming through the house. \nUltimately, the report sheds light on the sheer number of questions industry watchers have about HomePod and how it will work in a real-world setting. And we likely won’t have answers to all of those questions until the smart speaker hits store shelves on February 9. \nApple did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment on HomePod’s privacy features. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into Apple’s upcoming smart speaker, the HomePod, and how it’s designed with privacy in mind. As smart speakers become more common in our homes, privacy is a big concern, so it’s interesting to see how Apple is approaching this with their new device.\n\nWhen the HomePod launches next month, it will only work with the iCloud account of the person who sets it up. That means the built-in Siri assistant will respond only to that owner’s requests—like creating reminders, sending text messages, or giving calendar notifications. So if you’re not the designated user, Siri won’t perform those personal tasks for you.\n\nThere’s another layer to this privacy setup. Siri will only announce notifications like texts or calendar alerts when the owner is actually connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the HomePod. If they’re away from home, Siri stays quiet about any incoming messages. This helps keep personal information from being shared when you’re not around.\n\nApple first introduced the HomePod as a smart speaker focused on delivering high-quality sound—something they felt set it apart from other devices like Amazon Echo or Google Home. But beyond music, it also uses Siri to control smart home devices like lights and thermostats. Plus, with features like reading texts aloud and managing reminders, it aims to keep users informed without needing to pick up their phones.\n\nThat said, there are still some open questions about how the HomePod will work in more complex home situations. For example, what happens in families with multiple iCloud accounts? Some households might want to share certain information across accounts, while others might prefer to keep things separate. Apple hasn’t clarified how these scenarios will be handled yet.\n\nAll in all, while we know the HomePod is coming soon with some thoughtful privacy features, we’ll have to wait until it’s actually available to see how it performs in everyday life. It’s a reminder that as smart technology becomes more integrated into our homes, balancing convenience and privacy remains an ongoing challenge.\n\nSo, to sum up: Apple’s HomePod is set to offer personalized features tied closely to one user’s iCloud account and includes smart ways to protect your privacy by limiting notifications when you’re not home. It’s an intriguing step forward in smart speaker design that we’ll learn more about once it hits stores next month."}]}

For years, the relationship between Jay-Z and the Grammy Awards has been complicated, but recently, there’s been a notable shift.\n\nJay-Z, known for his incredible influence in hip-hop and beyond, was honored with The Recording Academy's President Merit Award. This recognition is a big deal because it acknowledges not just commercial success but also an artist’s impact on music and culture. The award was presented at the Clive Davis party, a prestigious event that celebrates outstanding achievements in the music world.\n\nThis moment marked a kind of reconciliation between Jay-Z and the Grammys. In the past, he had expressed frustration with the awards process, feeling that hip-hop artists were often overlooked. But receiving this honor showed a mutual respect developing between Jay-Z and the Recording Academy.\n\nSo, what does this all mean? It highlights how important it is for institutions like the Grammys to recognize diverse voices and contributions in music. It also shows how artists like Jay-Z can help push those conversations forward, ultimately shaping how success and artistry are celebrated.\n\nIn short, Jay-Z being honored with the President Merit Award at the Clive Davis party symbolizes progress in the music industry’s ongoing dialogue about recognition and respect. It’s a moment that acknowledges both his legacy and the evolving landscape of music awards."}]}

In Brooklyn, a federal judge named Nicholas Garaufis, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, presided over a 90-minute hearing. The case focused on whether the Trump administration could move forward with ending certain protections for young undocumented immigrants—often referred to as Dreamers—who were brought to the country as kids.\n\nDuring the hearing, Judge Garaufis didn’t hold back. He sharply criticized President Trump’s past comments about Latino immigrants, describing them as “vicious” and “extremely volatile.” The judge called these remarks incendiary and pointed out that many were simply wrong. His strong language underscored the seriousness with which the court was treating both the administration’s actions and the broader implications for immigrant communities.\n\nThis moment is part of a larger national conversation about immigration and legal protections. Around the same time, Senate Democrats agreed to reopen the government after a brief shutdown, on the condition that there would be debate and a vote on legislation providing Dreamers with a path to legal status. So, this hearing isn’t happening in isolation—it’s tied to ongoing efforts in Congress to address these complex issues.\n\nTo sum it up, this courtroom scene reflects deep divisions over immigration policy. A federal judge openly condemned inflammatory remarks by the president while weighing important legal questions about protections for young immigrants. It’s a reminder of how heated and pivotal this debate remains in our country today."}]}

A recent human rights order has brought attention to this ongoing problem through a tragic case that reveals just how urgent this situation is.\n\nSo, what exactly happened? In 2014, a young girl named Nalini was electrocuted to death in a textile mill where her parents worked. Her parents, Karunaiyammal and Balasubramani Bathran, were bonded laborers—meaning they were essentially trapped in forced labor to repay debts. They had left their six-year-old daughter at the factory while they made a quick trip home for a family event. When they returned, Nalini had died after accidentally touching a live wire. No adequate explanation or support was given to the family.\n\nThis heartbreaking incident isn’t isolated. Bonded labor, though banned in India since 1976, remains widespread. It’s especially common in industries like brick kilns, rice mills, and textiles—where workers are forced to work off debts that often multiply due to high interest and unfair accounting. Many workers end up paying back ten times what they originally borrowed. Employers frequently restrict their movements and even keep families living on-site to maintain control.\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission has now stepped in, ordering the Tamil Nadu government to officially recognize the Bathrans as bonded laborers and to compensate them accordingly. Campaigners highlight that around half a million manual laborers in Tamil Nadu alone are trapped in similar debt bondage situations.\n\nThis case shines a light on a grim reality: millions of people remain invisible victims of modern slavery within thriving industries. It reminds us how crucial it is to acknowledge and address these hidden injustices.\n\nIn short, bonded labor in Tamil Nadu’s textile mills is not just an isolated tragedy—it’s part of a much larger pattern of exploitation that demands attention and action."}]}

($1 = 0.8372 euros) (Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about the future of electric vehicles in Belgium and how one major car seller is setting ambitious goals. \n\nD’Ieteren, a key player in Belgium’s car market, has announced it wants 35 to 40 percent of its vehicle sales to be electric by 2025. That’s quite a bold target, especially when you consider that Volkswagen, whose brands D’Ieteren represents—including Skoda, Audi, and Lamborghini—aims for only about 25 percent electrified vehicle deliveries by the same year.\n\nSo why is D’Ieteren so optimistic about electric cars in Belgium? According to Denis Gorteman, who leads their car sales division, the local conditions are very favorable. For one, driving distances in regions like Flanders and Brussels tend to be short, making electric vehicles practical for everyday use. Also, a large number of people live in houses rather than apartments, which makes charging easier since homeowners typically have private parking spaces where they can install chargers.\n\nHowever, Gorteman points out that to reach these ambitious goals, Belgium will need to invest more in the electric vehicle sector and create policies that encourage people to switch to electric cars. Interestingly, he emphasizes that the industry isn’t asking for subsidies; instead, they want supportive policies that make electric vehicle use more attractive and accessible.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Volkswagen has committed a massive investment plan—34 billion euros—to boost its position as a global leader in electric vehicles. This shows how seriously the whole industry is taking the shift toward electrification.\n\nTo sum up, D’Ieteren’s push for a higher share of electric vehicle sales reflects both confidence in Belgium’s suitability for electric cars and a call for supportive policies to help meet these goals. It’s an exciting glimpse into how the future of driving could look in Belgium—and possibly beyond—in just a few years."}]}

But Intel did acknowledge, for the first time, that the fallout could hurt future results, a concern analysts brushed off.\nIntel also boosted its full-year forecast for 2018 above Wall Street expectations, saying it would boost dividends 10 percent to $1.20 on a yearly basis despite taking a $5.4 billion charge related to recent changes in U.S. tax law.\nIntel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the company would start shipping chips later this year with \"silicon-based changes\" to protect against the so-called Spectre and Meltdown security threats.\nRevenue from the company's higher-margin data center business rose about 20 percent to $5.58 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $5.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from Intel's PC group hit $9 billion for the quarter, a 2 percent decline from the year before, but ticked up 3 percent for the year to $34 billion.\nIntel predicted $65 billion in revenue for 2018, well above expectations of a $63.7 billion forecast.\nIn an interview ahead of Intel's earnings call with investors, Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said the company sees no \"meaningful impact\" on corporate earnings as a result of the security vulnerabilities, reiterating an assessment the company made on Jan. 3.\nThe improved dividend and forecasts are important because they are the first signal of how much success Intel has had in containing fallout from the so-called Spectre and Meltdown security flaws that could allow hackers to steal data from computers. The flaws were disclosed after the close of the currently reported quarter.\nThe problems affect most modern computing chips but analysts believe that Intel, the No.1 maker of microprocessors, is at greater risk because all the variants of the flaws affect its chips, which have a dominant market position in data centers.\nData center revenue growth was twice Wall Street expectations, coming at 20 percent from the year-ago quarter versus investor targets of 10 percent, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel.\nIntel warned in its earnings release that fallout from the discovery of Spectre and Meltdown could hurt future results, as well as customer relationships and the company's reputation.\nIt added that publicity over the two vulnerabilities could prompt outside parties to look for other security flaws, which could also harm the company's business.\nStill, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said that Intel investors would heave a sigh of relief.\n\"The chip vulnerability situation was an overhang over Intels shares and this robust quarter, healthy guidance, and underlying business metrics should help investors sleep a bit easier at night.\"\nDue to the tax charge, the company posted a loss of $687 million, or 15 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 30.\nExcluding items, the chipmaker earned $1.08 per share. Total revenue rose 4.1 percent to $17.05 billion.\nAnalysts on average were expecting a profit of 86 cents per share on a revenue of $16.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. (Reporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru, Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Jim Finkle in Toronto; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Lisa Shumaker)\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into Intel’s recent financial results and what they reveal about the company’s future—especially in light of some security concerns that have been in the spotlight.\n\nIntel, a giant in the chipmaking world, just reported better-than-expected profits and revenue for the last quarter of 2017. What’s driving this strong performance? It’s mainly their data center business, which saw a 20 percent jump in revenue to nearly $5.6 billion. That’s double what Wall Street analysts had predicted. Meanwhile, their traditional PC business slipped slightly but still managed steady annual growth.\n\nNow, why does this matter? Intel is shifting its focus from just supplying chips for personal computers to becoming a major player in data centers. These are the powerful hubs that support cloud computing and large-scale data processing. Growth here signals Intel is successfully transforming its business.\n\nBut there’s more to the story. Recently, Intel disclosed security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. These flaws affect many modern chips but hit Intel particularly hard because their processors are widely used in data centers. The company acknowledged that these issues might impact future earnings and customer trust. However, Intel’s CFO reassured investors that they don’t expect any meaningful impact on current earnings.\n\nIn fact, Intel is taking steps to address these security flaws by planning to ship chips with built-in protections later this year. They also raised their dividend by 10 percent and boosted their full-year revenue forecast to $65 billion, exceeding analyst expectations.\n\nSome analysts see this as a relief for investors who were worried about the security problems. The strong quarterly results and optimistic outlook suggest Intel is managing the risks well while continuing to grow its core businesses.\n\nTo sum up, despite some challenges on the security front, Intel’s recent earnings show a company that’s growing beyond PCs and strengthening its position in the lucrative data center market—all while reassuring investors with solid financial guidance and increased dividends. It’s a clear sign that Intel is navigating change and uncertainty with confidence."}]}

The total number of schools and learning centers was 940 as of November 30, 2017, an increase of 151 compared to 789 as of November 30, 2016, and a net increase of 41 compared to 899 as of August 31, 2017. The total number of schools was 82 as of November 30, 2017.\nMichael Minhong Yu, New Oriental's Executive Chairman, commented, \"We continued to see strong momentum in our key business units for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and achieved an accelerated revenue growth of 36.9% year-over-year, exceeding our initial expectation once again. It is also encouraging to see our deferred revenue balance recorded US$1,137.3 million at the end of the quarter, up 48.7% year-over-year. The solid top line growth is mainly driven by student enrollments. Our K-12 all-subjects after-school tutoring business growth was augmented in the second quarter with revenue up approximately 47% and enrollment up approximately 52% year-over-year. Moreover, our U-Can middle and high school all-subjects after-school tutoring business achieved revenue growth of approximately 45% and the revenue of POP Kids program rose approximately 51% year-over-year.\"\nChenggang Zhou, New Oriental's Chief Executive Officer, added, \"Guided by our well-proven 'Optimize the Market' strategy, we are steadily facilitating our capacity expansion across cities with strong growth potential and where we could achieve better operating efficiency. During this quarter, we added a net of 34 learning centers in 19 existing cities and tapped into the cities of Yinchuan, Shaoxing and Huzhou with our dual-teacher model classes implemented in three new schools and three learning centers. In addition, we acquired one kindergarten in Hong Kong, bringing our high-quality preschool education offerings to key cities in China. Altogether, our total square meters of classroom area by the end of this quarter expanded approximately 38% year-over-year. On the other hand, we continued to enhance our online and offline integrated standardized teaching system in the K-12 business with improved customer acquisition and retention, which markedly benefited our results in the second quarter. We also made continued progress in rolling out the standardized teaching system for overseas test preparation business, such as IELTS, TOEFL and SAT programs, in some of the large cities in China. Meanwhile, our pure online education platform, Koolearn.com , obtained year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 59.6%, with a significant rise of approximately 82% for registered users and 23% for paid users. It validates the success of our strategy to acquire and effectively retain customers and expand capacity, and we believe it will help taking more and more market shares and solidify our leadership position.\"\nStephen Zhihui Yang, New Oriental's Chief Financial Officer, commented, \"Despite the fact that the second quarter is traditionally the slowest quarter in the year, we still managed to improve the utilization of facilities compared with last quarter. This helps to lessen the pressure on margins as we continued the investment in capacity expansion and as expected we are on the right track to recover from the impact on the margins in the previous quarter. For the second quarter, the year-over-year decline of gross margin narrowed to 70 basis points from 280 basis points in the previous quarter, while Non-GAAP operating margin declined 150 basis points year-over-year, which is also recovering compared to 390 basis points in the previous quarter. We will continue to make efforts to enhance cost efficiency and improve utilization of facilities to drive the top line and bottom line growth. We still believe margin pressure will gradually lessen over the coming quarters. More importantly, we will increasingly benefit from economies of scale as we continue to push ahead our expansion strategy and work to deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders.\"\nFinancial Results for the Second Fiscal Quarter Ended November 30, 2017\nNet Revenues\nFor the second fiscal quarter of 2018, New Oriental reported net revenues of US$467.2 million, representing a 36.9% increase year-over-year. Net revenues from educational programs and services for the second fiscal quarter were US$422.6 million, representing a 35.4% increase year-over-year. The growth was mainly driven by increases in student enrollments in K-12 after-school tutoring courses.\nTotal student enrollments in academic subjects tutoring and test preparation courses in the second fiscal quarter of 2018 increased by 43% year-over-year to approximately 1,877,100.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nOperating costs and expenses for the quarter were US$480.3 million, representing a 40.8% increase year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating costs and expenses for the quarter, which exclude share-based compensation expenses, were US$470.9 million, representing a 39.0% increase year-over-year.\nCost of revenues increased by 39.1% year-over-year to US$227.3 million, primarily due to increases in teachers' compensation for more teaching hours and rental cost for increased number of schools and learning centers in operation. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 38.2% year-over-year to US$72.1 million, primarily due to increases in brand promotion expenses and selling and marketing staff's compensation. General and administrative expenses for the quarter increased by 44.2% year-over-year to US$180.9 million. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expenses, were US$171.6 million, representing a 39.2% increase year-over-year, primarily due to increased headcount as the Company expanded its network of schools and learning centers, as well as increases in R&D expenses and human resources expenses related to the development of our online and offline integrated education ecosystem.\nIn the second quarter, total share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating costs and expenses, increased by 330.2% year-over-year to US$9.3 million, due to the grants of a total of 1.5 million restricted share units of the Company to employees and directors in October 2017 with graded vesting over three years.\nOperating Income (Loss) and Operating Margin\nOperating loss was US$13.1 million, compared to an income of US$0.2 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year.

Capital expenditures for the quarter were US$45.7 million, which were primarily attributable to the opening of four new schools and 59 learning centers and renovations at existing learning centers.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of November 30, 2017, New Oriental had cash and cash equivalents of US$818.1 million, compared to US$641.0 million as of May 31, 2017. In addition, the Company had US$87.5 million in term deposits and US$1,522.8 million in short-term investment as of November 30, 2017.\nNew Oriental's deferred revenue balance, which is cash collected from registered students for courses and recognized proportionally as revenue as the instructions are delivered, at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was US$1,137.3 million, a\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s episode, where we’re diving into the latest financial update from New Oriental Education and Technology Group, China’s largest provider of private educational services. We’ll explore how the company performed in its second fiscal quarter of 2018, which ended in November 2017, and what that means for their growth and strategy moving forward.\n\nSo, what’s the big picture here? New Oriental reported strong revenue growth but faced some challenges with profitability. Let’s break down the numbers and key highlights step by step.\n\nFirst off, total net revenues jumped nearly 37% compared to the same quarter last year, reaching about 467 million US dollars. This impressive growth was mainly driven by increased student enrollments—specifically in K-12 after-school tutoring programs and test preparation courses. In fact, total student enrollments rose by 43%, hitting nearly 1.9 million students for the quarter.\n\nDespite this revenue boost, New Oriental recorded an operating loss of around 13 million dollars this quarter, compared to a small operating income in the previous year’s quarter. When excluding share-based compensation expenses—a non-GAAP measure—the operating loss was smaller, about 3.8 million dollars. This shows some pressure on profitability, partly due to investments in expanding their capacity and resources.\n\nDigging into expenses, operating costs rose by about 41%. This included higher teacher compensation for more teaching hours and increased rental costs for new schools and learning centers. Selling and marketing expenses also went up, reflecting greater brand promotion efforts and staff costs. Administrative expenses grew as well, linked to hiring more staff and investing in research and development to improve their integrated online and offline education ecosystem.\n\nOn the positive side, net income attributable to New Oriental decreased by nearly 59% year-over-year to 4.3 million dollars. However, on a non-GAAP basis—excluding those share-based compensation costs—net income actually increased by about 8.5%, reaching 13.6 million dollars. Earnings per share followed a similar pattern.\n\nNew Oriental also expanded its physical footprint significantly during this quarter. They added dozens of new learning centers across existing cities and entered new markets with their dual-teacher model classes. They even acquired a kindergarten in Hong Kong to broaden their preschool offerings. Their classroom space grew by roughly 38% year-over-year.\n\nOnline education showed remarkable growth too. Their platform Koolearn.com saw revenue rise almost 60%, with registered users up by 82% and paid users increasing by 23%. This highlights how their blended approach of offline centers combined with online platforms is gaining traction.\n\nFinancially, New Oriental maintained a healthy cash position with over 800 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end, plus significant short-term investments. Their deferred revenue balance—cash collected upfront from students but recognized over time—also increased substantially by nearly 49%, signaling strong future revenue streams.\n\nTo sum up, New Oriental is experiencing rapid top-line growth fueled by rising enrollments and expansion into new markets, both physical and digital. While profitability has faced some pressure due to investments in capacity and infrastructure, non-GAAP measures suggest underlying improvements. Their strategy of combining offline tutoring centers with online platforms appears to be working well as they build scale and strengthen their market leadership.\n\nThat wraps up our look at New Oriental’s second fiscal quarter results from late 2017. It’s a clear example of a company balancing growth initiatives with cost management as it navigates a competitive education landscape in China.\n\nThanks for listening today. Stay tuned for more insights on education and business trends next time."}]}

If you’re a shareholder of DDR’s common or preferred shares, understanding how your dividends are allocated for tax purposes is important as you prepare your federal income tax return.\n\nDDR Corp., a real estate investment trust that owns and manages shopping centers across the U.S. and Puerto Rico, issued dividends throughout 2017 to its shareholders. These dividends come in different forms: ordinary dividends, capital gains, and return of capital. Each type has its own tax implications.\n\nFor common shares, DDR paid dividends quarterly in 2017. Each quarter, shareholders received about 3.5 cents in ordinary dividends and roughly 15.5 cents as a return of capital per share, totaling 19 cents per quarter. Over the full year, that adds up to approximately 14 cents in ordinary dividends and about 62 cents in return of capital, summing to 76 cents per share for the year.\n\nReturn of capital is essentially money returned to shareholders from their original investment rather than from company profits, which affects the cost basis of the shares for tax purposes.\n\nFor preferred shares, DDR has several classes—A, J, and K—each with its own dividend schedule and amounts. For example, Class A preferred shares paid nearly 98 cents total in ordinary dividends during the year, while Class J shares paid about $1.63 and Class K shares around $1.56.\n\nImportantly, all these dividends reported on Form 1099-DIV must be included on your federal tax return for 2017.

REUTERS/Dadang Tri/Files Police in West Java province said three boys, as young as seven, who figured in the videos are now in the care of social workers.\nAt least seven people have been arrested, including the mothers of two of the boys, on suspicion of violating child protection and pornography laws and could face up to 15 years in prison.\n“Results of the preliminary investigation show that the director sold the videos to someone in Russia and Canada,” said regional police spokesman Yusri Yunus, adding that the motive of those involved was to make money.\n“We are still investigating and coordinating with the national cyber crime unit.”\nThe director received 31 million rupiah ($2,307) to make the videos, media have said.\nIndonesia has been vulnerable to child pornography and sexual abuse of minors because of poverty and lax enforcement of laws in the past.\nAuthorities stopped 92 convicted Australian pedophiles from entering the country last year, based on immigration data.\nIn a case that shocked Southeast Asia, a British court handed Richard Huckle 22 life sentences in 2016 for abusing up to 200 babies and children, mostly in Malaysia, and sharing images of his crimes on the dark web.\nUNICEF says the Philippines is the number one global source of child pornography.\n($1=13,435.0000 rupiah)\nReporting by Jessica Damiana; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re discussing a troubling investigation unfolding in Indonesia involving child exploitation and the possible connections to an international network. This case highlights some serious challenges in combating child abuse in the region.\n\nSo, what’s happening? Indonesian police are looking into videos that have been circulating on social media. These videos show adult women engaged in sexual acts with young boys, some as young as seven years old. The children involved are now under the care of social workers, and authorities have arrested at least seven people, including the mothers of two of the boys. These suspects face charges related to child protection and pornography laws, carrying potential prison sentences of up to 15 years.\n\nOne key detail is that the person directing these videos reportedly sold them to buyers in Russia and Canada. The motive appears to be financial gain, with the director receiving about 31 million rupiah, roughly two thousand three hundred dollars, for making these videos. Police are continuing their investigation and working closely with the national cybercrime unit to uncover more about this network.\n\nThis case is part of a larger issue in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, where poverty and weak enforcement of laws have made children vulnerable to exploitation. For example, just last year, Indonesian authorities prevented nearly a hundred convicted Australian pedophiles from entering the country. And there have been other high-profile cases in the region, like Richard Huckle, a British offender sentenced to life for abusing children across Malaysia.\n\nOrganizations like UNICEF also point out that neighboring countries face similar problems; for instance, the Philippines is noted as a major source of child pornography globally.\n\nTo sum up, this investigation in Indonesia shines a light on the ongoing struggle against child exploitation in parts of Southeast Asia. It’s a complex issue involving local vulnerabilities and international criminal networks. Authorities are actively working to bring those responsible to justice and protect these children from further harm."}]}

They’ve just completed an important transaction involving what are known as perpetual subordinated notes.\n\nSo, what exactly happened? Aroundtown SA successfully issued these notes, raising 400 million euros. These are a type of debt instrument that doesn’t have a fixed maturity date, which means the company isn’t required to repay the principal at a set time. Instead, they pay interest indefinitely, or until they decide to call back the notes.\n\nThe issue price for these notes was just under 98.2% of their principal value. To put it simply, investors paid slightly less than the full face value for each note. The coupon rate, which is the annual interest payment based on the note’s principal, is set at 2.125%. This rate represents the return investors will receive each year.\n\nAnother key detail is the first call date, which is scheduled for 2024. That means Aroundtown has the option to repay the principal and stop paying interest starting from that year if they choose to do so.\n\nIn summary, Aroundtown SA has raised significant funds through this issuance of perpetual subordinated notes, offering investors a steady interest rate with flexibility on when the principal might be repaid. It’s a strategic financial move that supports their ongoing operations or growth plans while balancing investor returns.\n\nThat wraps up our look at Aroundtown’s recent bond issuance and what it means in practical terms. Thanks for listening."}]}

( intel.ly/2D0vgv8 ) (Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about a major security concern that shook the tech world—those infamous Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. These flaws affect the very chips inside almost every phone, computer, and server, putting sensitive information like passwords at risk.\n\nSo, what exactly happened? Back in early 2018, Google revealed that these chip vulnerabilities could allow hackers to peek into a device’s memory. That’s a big deal because it means your private data could be exposed. The chips impacted come from major manufacturers like Intel, AMD, and ARM.\n\nNow, you might wonder how tech companies responded to such a serious threat. Google was actually ahead of the curve. They started rolling out software patches as early as September of the previous year. By December, they had developed fixes even for the trickier parts of the problem—especially a version of Spectre called Variant 2, which is notoriously hard to patch without slowing down systems.\n\nGoogle’s Ben Treynor Sloss described these vulnerabilities as some of the toughest to fix in a decade. Despite this challenge, Google managed to patch their cloud services without any noticeable slowdown.\n\nMicrosoft also released patches but admitted that their fix for Spectre Variant 2 caused some older Intel-based computers and servers to slow down noticeably. Meanwhile, Intel committed to releasing patches for 90 percent of chips made in the last five years by mid-January 2018, with plans to tackle older chips afterward.\n\nIn summary, while these chip vulnerabilities posed a serious risk, companies like Google and Intel worked quickly to develop and deploy patches. And importantly, Google demonstrated it was possible to protect systems against these threats without sacrificing performance—at least on their cloud services. It’s a reminder of how complex and critical cybersecurity can be in our connected world."}]}

As the group’s presence in the Middle East crumbles, some are returning with family members. \nOnly a small number of the 290 toddlers and children who left Germany or were born in Syria and Iraq had returned thus far, Maassen said. Many were likely to still be in the region, or perhaps moving to areas such as Afghanistan, where Islamic State remains strong. \nHe said Germany should review laws restricting surveillance of minors under the age of 14 to prepare for the increased risk of attacks by children as young as nine who grew up in Islamic State schools. \n“We see that children who grew up with Islamic State were brainwashed in the schools and the kindergartens of the IS,” he said. “They were confronted early with the IS ideology ... learned to fight, and were in some cases forced to participate in the abuse of prisoners, or even the killing of prisoners.” \nHe said security officials believed such children could later carry out violent attacks in Germany. \n“We have to consider that these children could be living time bombs,” he said. “There is a danger that these children come back brainwashed with a mission to carry out attacks.” \nMaassen’s comments were the first specific estimate of the number of children affected, following his initial warning in October that such children could pose a threat after being indoctrinated in battlefield areas. \nThe radicalisation of minors has been a big topic in Germany given that three of five Islamist attacks in Germany in 2016 were carried out by minors, and a 12-year-old boy was also detained after trying to bomb a Christmas market in Ludwigshafen. \nThe German government says it has evidence that more than 960 people left Germany for Iraq and Syria through November 2017 to fight for the Islamic State jihadist group, of which about a third are believed to have returned to Germany. Another 150 likely died in combat, according to government data. \nMaassen said Islamic State also continued to target vulnerable youths in Germany through the Internet and social media, often providing slick advertising or age-appropriate propaganda to recruit them to join the jihadist group. \n“Islamic State uses headhunters who scour the Internet for children that can be approached and tries to radicalise these children, or recruit these children for terrorist attacks,” he said. Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into a serious and complex issue: the concerns around children connected to returning Islamist fighters in Germany. Specifically, how these kids might pose security risks after being exposed to extremist ideologies.\n\nGermany’s domestic intelligence chief has raised alarms about the children of Islamic State fighters who are coming back to the country. These aren’t just any children—they’ve often grown up in conflict zones under the influence of ISIS, attending their schools and kindergartens, where they were indoctrinated from a very young age. Some were even forced to take part in violent acts, including abuse or worse.\n\nRight now, nearly a thousand people from Germany are believed to have traveled to join ISIS in the Middle East. As ISIS loses ground, some fighters are returning home with their families. Among these returnees are about 290 toddlers and children who either left Germany or were born abroad in places like Syria and Iraq. So far, only a small number of these children have come back, but officials expect more could return in the future.\n\nWhat’s particularly concerning is that many of these kids are very young—some as young as nine—and may have been “brainwashed” during their time with ISIS. Because of this, German intelligence is urging the government to reconsider laws that limit surveillance on minors under 14 years old. The idea is to be prepared for the possibility that these children could carry out attacks once back on German soil.\n\nThis worry isn’t unfounded. In recent years, several attacks in Germany were carried out by minors, including a case where a 12-year-old attempted a bombing at a Christmas market. ISIS also actively targets vulnerable youths online, using social media and slick propaganda designed specifically for young audiences to recruit them.\n\nIn summary, German security officials see these children as potential “time bombs” due to their early exposure to extremist ideology and violence. The challenge lies in balancing legal protections for minors with the need to prevent future attacks. It’s a stark reminder of how the impact of conflict and radicalization can reach even the youngest and most vulnerable—and why vigilance remains crucial.\n\nThanks for listening."}]}

It’s a story about research, intelligence, and how information moved through different channels during a highly charged election.\n\nHere’s how it unfolded. The Clinton campaign hired a firm called Fusion GPS. Their job was to dig up opposition research on the Trump campaign. Fusion GPS then brought in Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer, to help with the investigation.\n\nSteele put together what became known as the Steele dossier. This document was based largely on Russian sources and contained a mix of rumors, hearsay, and some verified facts. Its main claim was that there was collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.\n\nThis dossier eventually made its way to the FBI. The bureau used it as part of the justification to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. This investigation might have included obtaining a judicial warrant to monitor certain Trump officials.\n\nMeanwhile, Fusion GPS arranged for Steele to privately share details of the dossier with select journalists. This ensured that parts of the dossier became public knowledge even before any official conclusions were drawn.\n\nSo, in summary, this sequence involved an opposition research firm hiring a former spy, who compiled a controversial dossier that played a key role in triggering an FBI investigation, while also reaching the media early on. It’s a clear example of how intelligence, politics, and media intersected during a pivotal moment in American politics."}]}

Garrett Pagon, President and co-founder, will step into the role of CEO. Balkissoon will focus on further building the technology and organization of OGSystems’ recent tech start-up spinout, GeoSpark Analytics, serving as the new company’s CEO ( http://bizj.us/1pgb99 ). OGSystems also announced the recent promotion of Steve Martin as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Dan Ehrmantraut to Chief Financial Officer (CFO).\nThis press release features multimedia.

(Pictured left to right: Dan Ehrmantraut, Garrett Pagon, and Steve Martin) (Photo: Business Wire)\n“Since OGSystems’ founding, Garrett and I have put our heart and soul into the mission of making a positive impact on national security and the goal of providing growth opportunities for our people,” Balkissoon said. “We have a relentless focus on finding the right people, playing to their strengths, and empowering them to Own the Outcome. As co-founders, we’ve watched the company grow in ways we couldn’t imagine by enabling others to step into new roles with an eye towards delivering the best execution in the business. Having Garrett by my side has been instrumental to the journey as CEO, and that formula doesn’t change as I transition to Chairman with me by his.”\nPagon is a graduate of Stanford University and served as an intelligence officer for the United States Air Force before he and Balkissoon founded OGSystems in 2005. Through his leadership, the company has become a recognized and trusted prime contractor capable of winning and executing large engineering projects for the IC. He is responsible for scaling an entrepreneurial outfit into a large and reliable organization, while keeping the innovative spirit of the original culture.\n“People are the secret sauce at OGSystems,” said Pagon. “We give leaders from within an opportunity to grow and we recognize those responsible for our success. Both Steve and Dan have the right combination of skill, commitment to leading their teams, and tremendous respect from their peers and industry partners.”\nWith more than 20 years of DoD and IC experience - including over 10 years with OGSystems - Steve Martin has helped build the culture, client relationships, partnerships, and approaches that are the foundation of the company’s success. Previously serving as the Executive Partner responsible for performance on all client programs, Martin led the doubling of OGSystems revenues in the last three years. Known for a commitment to personnel development and increasing mission performance through innovation, he has overseen increases in key metrics such as employee retention to over twice the industry average.\nDan Ehrmantraut joined OGSystems in 2014 and quickly established the growing organization’s first in-house corporate finance and accounting department. In three years, he has proven himself as an outstanding leader in command of all financial aspects of the business and now formally assumes the role from Bill Earle as the interim CFO. As CFO, Ehrmantraut manages an agile, high-performing team responsible for contract/subcontract management, corporate accounting, payroll, program control, cost proposals, and corporate financial reporting and forecasting.\nAbout OGSystems\nOGSystems’ (OGS) mission is to provide technically advanced geospatial and security solutions to customers through constant innovation, effecting positive change in every engagement. In an industry accustomed to long and inefficient system development cycles, OGS thinks differently - we are an alternative for DoD and IC clients seeking nimble companies to solve their most difficult problems. Headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, with regional offices in St. Louis, Missouri, San Diego, California, and Portland, Oregon, OGS employs over 300 geospatial engineers, software developers, data scientists and mission subject matter experts.

The co-founder Omar Balkissoon is moving from his role as CEO to become Chairman of the Board. Meanwhile, Garrett Pagon, who co-founded the company alongside Omar and currently serves as President, will step up as the new CEO. Omar isn’t stepping away entirely; he’s focusing on leading GeoSpark Analytics, a recent tech startup spun out from OGSystems.\n\nAlongside these changes, OGSystems has promoted Steve Martin to Chief Operating Officer. Steve has been with the company for over a decade and played a key role in doubling its revenues in just three years. He’s known for building strong client relationships and fostering a culture where employees thrive. Dan Ehrmantraut has also been promoted to Chief Financial Officer. Since joining in 2014, Dan has set up the company’s first in-house finance and accounting team and now leads all financial operations.\n\nGarrett Pagon brings a strong background to his new role. A Stanford graduate and former Air Force intelligence officer, he has helped transform OGSystems from a small startup into a trusted contractor capable of handling large engineering projects. Garrett emphasizes that people are the “secret sauce” at OGSystems, highlighting how internal leadership development drives their success.\n\nAt its core, OGSystems focuses on delivering innovative geospatial and security solutions with agility and technical expertise. With over 300 employees spread across offices in Virginia, Missouri, California, and Oregon, the company continues to push forward in an industry often challenged by slow development cycles.\n\nTo sum it up, these leadership changes at OGSystems reflect a commitment to growth, innovation, and empowering talented leaders within the organization. With Omar guiding from the board and Garrett leading as CEO, supported by Steve and Dan in key executive roles, OGSystems is well-positioned to keep advancing its mission in national security technology.\n\nThanks for listening."}]}

This memo, written by Republican members of Congress, alleges that the FBI misused its surveillance powers. But the FBI has responded with serious concerns about the accuracy of this document.\n\nSo, what’s going on here? The memo in question is classified, meaning it contains sensitive information not meant for public eyes. Republicans claim it reveals abuses of power by the FBI during surveillance activities. However, the FBI has publicly opposed releasing this memo, expressing what they call \"grave concerns\" about how accurate it is.\n\nThis situation highlights a tense clash between political groups and a key federal agency. On one side, you have lawmakers pushing for transparency or accountability based on their interpretation of the memo. On the other, the FBI worries that releasing this information could mislead the public or compromise ongoing operations.\n\nIn summary, this is a complex debate about surveillance, trust, and government oversight. The FBI’s objection to the memo’s release centers on doubts about its truthfulness and potential risks involved. It’s a reminder of how sensitive and contentious issues around national security and privacy can become when politics enter the mix."}]}

That’s exactly what happened in Hawaii on a Saturday morning in January 2018. The message was sent out by mistake, causing widespread fear and confusion across the islands.\n\nToday, we’re going to talk about that false missile alert—what happened, how it unfolded, and why it matters. It’s a reminder of how a simple human error can create a moment of panic for thousands of people.\n\nSo here’s what went down: early on January 13th, residents of Hawaii received an emergency alert on their phones and through broadcast channels. The message warned that a ballistic missile was headed their way and advised immediate protective action. Understandably, many people were terrified, scrambling to find safety or contact loved ones.\n\nBut shortly after, officials confirmed that the alert was sent out accidentally. It was a human error during a routine test that mistakenly triggered the real emergency notification system. There was no actual missile threat at all.\n\nThis incident highlights how critical it is for emergency communication systems to be managed carefully. False alarms can cause unnecessary panic and stress, but they also show the importance of having clear protocols and quick ways to correct mistakes.\n\nIn the end, while the alert was a false alarm, it served as a wake-up call for improving emergency preparedness and communication in Hawaii and beyond. It reminds us just how quickly things can escalate—and how vital it is to handle such systems with precision.\n\nSo, the key takeaway here is that even well-intended safety measures can go wrong, but learning from those moments helps make communities safer in the long run."}]}

(the \"Issuer\"), intends to privately offer $1,150.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The Issuer intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to pay the purchase price for the acquisition of AmeriPride Services Inc., repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses.\nThe offering of the Notes is being made in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), to investors who are reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act or to investors outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.\nAbout Aramark\nAramark (NYSE: ARMK) proudly serves Fortune 500 companies, world champion sports teams, state-of-the-art healthcare providers, the world's leading educational institutions, iconic destinations and cultural attractions, and numerous municipalities in 19 countries around the world.

Forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations, estimates, projections, and assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.

Now, what does that mean? Essentially, they’re issuing debt securities—think of it like borrowing money from investors—with a promise to pay back the principal amount plus interest by 2028. These notes are “senior unsecured,” meaning they have priority over some other debts but are not backed by specific assets.\n\nThe company intends to use the funds raised from this offering, along with cash they already have, for a few key purposes. First, to finance the purchase of AmeriPride Services Inc., which is a strategic acquisition for Aramark. Second, to pay down borrowings under their revolving credit facility—a type of flexible loan. And third, to cover related fees and expenses connected with these financial activities.\n\nIt’s important to note that this offering is being made privately and relies on exemptions from the usual registration requirements under U.S. securities law. This means the notes are being sold only to qualified institutional buyers or investors outside the United States who meet certain criteria. Because of this, these notes aren’t available for public trading in the U.S. without proper registration or exemptions.\n\nFor some context about Aramark itself: they operate in 19 countries and serve a diverse range of clients—from Fortune 500 companies and healthcare providers to sports teams and educational institutions. With over 270,000 employees, they focus not just on business but also on social responsibility, including workforce diversity, health and wellness initiatives, environmental protection, and community support.\n\nFinally, as with many companies issuing forward-looking financial statements, Aramark reminds investors that actual outcomes may vary due to risks and uncertainties inherent in business operations and market conditions.\n\nTo sum up, Aramark is raising capital through a private note offering to support its acquisition strategy and manage existing debt, all while continuing its broad service operations globally. It’s a move that reflects both their growth ambitions and financial planning efforts."}]}

You might expect big global banks to charge hefty fees for handling major debt offerings, but right now, something unusual is happening.\n\nWe’re seeing fierce competition among banks to underwrite these debt deals, so much so that some of the biggest names are practically working for free. Recently, seven banks, including Barclays and Standard Chartered, helped sell $1.3 billion worth of dollar-denominated bonds for three state-owned Indian companies. And here’s the kicker: each bank received just one dollar in underwriting fees for their work.\n\nWhy is this happening? The intense competition means banks are willing to accept minimal or symbolic fees just to secure these deals. It’s a strategy to maintain or grow their presence in a fast-expanding market. While it might seem like a loss in the short term, being involved in these transactions can open doors to future business opportunities.\n\nSo, what does this tell us? In Asia’s U.S.-dollar bond market, demand is high and competition among banks is fierce. To stay relevant and win deals, some banks are effectively offering their services free of charge. It’s a vivid example of how market dynamics can reshape traditional business models.\n\nIn summary, the rush to underwrite debt in Asia’s dollar bond market has pushed some global banks to work for next to nothing. This shift highlights just how competitive and fast-growing this financial space has become."}]}

REUTERS/Aaron Lynett More than 17,000 businesses and homes were without electricity in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, according to the Nova Scotia Power website. Most departing and arriving flights were canceled or delayed at Halifax Stanfield airport.\nIn Montreal, 85 flights were canceled on Thursday because of snowstorms affecting airports in Canada’s so-called “Maritime” provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island and through much of the Eastern United States, an airport spokeswoman said.\n“For the Maritimes, it is a cocktail of precipitation and strong winds,” Environment Canada meteorologist Jean-Philippe Begin said by phone.\nThe fast-developing storm bringing high winds and heavy snowfall has been dubbed by forecasters as a “weather bomb,” a “bombogenesis” or “bomb cyclone.” Wind speeds of up to 110 kilometers (68 miles) an hour are expected in some parts of the Maritimes, Begin said, and the storm will also dump up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) of snow in areas of Eastern Quebec.\nReporting by Darren Calabrese in Halifax, Nova Scotia; Writing by Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Jim Finkle and Bernadette Baum\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re talking about a powerful winter storm that has been making its presence felt across Eastern Canada. This storm arrived with a mix of heavy snow, strong winds, and widespread disruptions.\n\nSo, what’s going on exactly? Starting Thursday, a massive storm moving up from the United States began impacting parts of Eastern Canada, including the Maritime provinces like Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. This storm isn’t just your average snowfall—it’s what meteorologists call a “bomb cyclone” or “bombogenesis.” That means it’s a rapidly intensifying storm with strong winds and heavy precipitation.\n\nIn Nova Scotia alone, more than 17,000 homes and businesses lost power as the storm hit. Airports were also affected—Halifax Stanfield saw most flights canceled or delayed. Montreal’s airport canceled 85 flights that day due to the snowstorms sweeping through the region.\n\nThe weather conditions are quite intense. Environment Canada described it as a “cocktail of precipitation and strong winds.” Wind speeds could reach up to 110 kilometers per hour—that’s about 68 miles an hour—in some Maritime areas. On top of that, some parts of Eastern Quebec might see up to 50 centimeters, or roughly 20 inches, of snow.\n\nThis kind of storm can cause significant challenges, from travel disruptions to power outages.

It might sound unusual at first, but Flicks are designed to help with the precise timing needed for digital audio and video.\n\nSo, what exactly are Flicks? Simply put, a Flick is a tiny unit of time, just a bit longer than a nanosecond. But here’s the clever part: Flicks are made to divide media frame rates and audio sampling frequencies perfectly. This means they can measure the exact timing needed for smooth playback and synchronization in digital media without rounding errors or awkward fractions.\n\nThe idea came from Christopher Horvath, a former architect at Facebook’s Story Studio. After leaving that team earlier this year, he moved over to Facebook’s social virtual reality division. His work on Flicks shows how innovations can come from inside these creative tech teams. For some background, Story Studio was known for its VR films like \"Dear Angelica,\" which even earned an Emmy nomination. Horvath himself won an Emmy for another Oculus film called \"Henry.\"\n\nFacebook eventually closed Story Studio to focus on other projects, but the impact of its people and ideas lives on. Flicks are now part of that legacy—a precise tool that helps developers handle the tricky task of timing in virtual reality and media production.\n\nTo sum it up, Flicks are a new, ultra-precise unit of time created to make digital audio and video run smoother by matching the exact timing needs of different frame rates and frequencies. It’s a small but important step forward in how we measure and manage time in the digital world."}]}

These agreements represent potential sales of Qualcomm components worth at least two billion dollars over the next three years. While these agreements aren’t final contracts yet, they show strong interest in continuing business with Qualcomm, especially for technology related to RF Front-End components, which are crucial for mobile devices.\n\nThis support comes at a critical time. Qualcomm is currently facing an unsolicited $103 billion takeover bid from Broadcom, another chip giant. Qualcomm has publicly rejected the offer, saying it undervalues the company. At a Qualcomm event in Beijing, representatives from the Chinese firms voiced concerns that a Broadcom acquisition could negatively impact investment in chip technology development.\n\nIt’s important to note that any merger like this would face intense regulatory scrutiny in China. Qualcomm has had regulatory challenges there before and China is actively pushing to grow its own chip industry, aiming to be a global leader by 2030. The government is investing heavily in local companies to achieve that goal.\n\nQualcomm’s president highlighted that China is already their second-largest market and is expected to become their biggest soon. The strong backing from Chinese manufacturers shows how crucial Qualcomm remains in this rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nTo sum up, Qualcomm’s recent agreements with major Chinese smartphone makers underline its vital role in the global chip industry and signal solid support amid a high-stakes takeover battle. It’s a clear message that these companies want to keep working with Qualcomm as the tech world watches closely what comes next."}]}

The bank paused with raising rates then after lifting borrowing costs twice since August, and analysts expect the next move in February.\n“I was one of two who thinks inflation risks are slightly higher,” Benda said in the interview. “This basically justifies, or would give us the possibility to raise interest rates at a slightly faster tempo than the trajectory we have in the forecast.” (Reporting by Jason Hovet)\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about the recent outlook on inflation and interest rates from the Czech central bank. There’s been some discussion about whether the bank might need to raise rates more quickly than previously expected.\n\nVojtech Benda, a member of the bank’s board, shared some insights in a recent interview. He pointed out that inflation risks are slightly higher than the bank’s current forecasts suggest. This is important because it could influence how the bank approaches its interest rate policy moving forward.\n\nTo give a bit of background, the Czech central bank had raised borrowing costs twice between August and December. Then, in December, they decided to pause those increases. However, Benda was one of only two board members who voted in favor of raising rates at that meeting, signaling some concern about inflation pressures.\n\nWhat Benda is saying is that these elevated inflation risks might justify a quicker pace of rate hikes than what the bank’s official forecast currently shows. In other words, if inflation continues to be a bit more persistent or stronger than expected, the bank could respond by tightening monetary policy faster to keep things under control.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting the next decision on rates in February. Benda’s comments suggest that while the bank has paused for now, it remains ready to act if inflation risks don’t ease.\n\nSo, to sum it up: Inflation in the Czech Republic could be running hotter than anticipated, and this might lead the central bank to raise interest rates more quickly than its current plans indicate. It’s a reminder that monetary policy often needs to stay flexible in response to changing economic conditions."}]}

He was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on the eve of Trump’s arrival at the Swiss resort.\nMnuchin’s comments provided a fresh trigger for selling of the dollar, which has been on the back foot for months on the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve is no longer the only game in town when it comes to tighter monetary policy, as growth in other regions - in Europe in particular - picks up speed.\n“The Mnuchin comments have helped feed it (the weaker dollar) a little bit, but they certainly didn’t get the move going in the first place,” said BMO Capital Markets currency strategist Stephen Gallo, in London.\n“He gave the green light for benign neglect of the currency, in the short run. It’s going down for a number of fundamental reasons and he’s saying he’s not going to stop it.”\nThe dollar index , which measures the greenback’s value against a basket of six major currencies, fell below the 90.00 threshold for the first time since December 2014 on Wednesday. It was last down 0.6 percent at 89.632.\nWhite House officials said on Tuesday that Trump would use his speech at Davos on Friday to stress his “America First” policies.\nUnder that agenda, Trump has threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, disavowed the global climate change accord and criticised global institutions including the United Nations and NATO.\n“It feels like the next few weeks could be a watershed moment for world trade and protectionism,” ING currency strategist Viraj Patel said in London.\n“(Trump‘s) ‘America First’ ideology...remains a risk strategy for the dollar – and for a U.S. economy that relies on the kindness of strangers to fund its structural external deficit,” he added.\nAs the dollar fell broadly, the euro touched a fresh three-year peak of $1.2356 , while sterling soared to its highest level since Britain’s June 2016 vote to leave the European Union, at $1.4152.\nInvestors are keenly awaiting the European Central Bank’s meeting on Thursday for clues on the outlook for monetary policy in the euro zone.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar fell below the 110 threshold for the first time in four months, last trading down 0.8 percent at 109.39 yen.

Recently, the U.S. dollar hit a notable low against other major currencies, sparking conversations about America’s economic direction and international relationships.\n\nSo, what’s driving this change? It all started when U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made a surprising statement at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Contrary to the usual push for a strong dollar, he said a weaker dollar is actually good for American trade. This was quite a departure from traditional views and gave investors new reasons to sell off the dollar.\n\nBut Mnuchin wasn’t the initial spark for the dollar’s decline. Experts point out that the dollar has been weakening for months due to broader economic factors. For one, the U.S. Federal Reserve isn’t the only central bank tightening monetary policy anymore. Growth in Europe is picking up speed, making other currencies more attractive.\n\nAt the same time, President Donald Trump’s upcoming speech at Davos is expected to emphasize his “America First” policies. These include threats to pull out of trade agreements and criticism of global institutions. Such protectionist stances add uncertainty to international trade and put additional pressure on the dollar.\n\nAs the dollar slipped, other currencies responded strongly. The euro reached a three-year high against the dollar, while Britain’s pound hit its highest level since the Brexit vote in 2016. Even against Japan’s yen, the dollar dropped to levels not seen in four months.\n\nLooking ahead, investors are closely watching upcoming events like the European Central Bank’s meeting for clues on monetary policy that could influence these trends further.\n\nIn summary, what we’re seeing is a complex mix of policy shifts and economic developments leading to a weaker dollar and stronger rival currencies. This situation highlights how interconnected global markets are and how political decisions can ripple through economies worldwide."}]}

But do I think there will be much of it? No,” Kelly said. “Sellers that have been in this business a long time are very reluctant to take out an asset that has generated such stable returns historically.” \nHe said he did not expect to see an attractive acquisition opportunity in the sector unless there was significant stress specific to one of the owners. \nAsked specifically about rivals GECAS and Avolon, Kelly said it was “impossible to say” what might happen, with both businesses showing consistent profitability. \nGECAS owner General Electric ( GE.N ) indicated last week that it was looking closely at breaking itself up as the conglomerate announced more than $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws. \nAvolon’s ultimate owner HNA group has admitted in recent months to liquidity problems. \nKelly said the aviation sector was facing the prospect of increases in two key input costs: fuel and interest rates. \nWhile the oil price could tax some airlines if it climbs to $80 from just under $70, the business models of some airlines could be “stretched” he said. [L8N1PH5K5] Higher oil could nudge carriers towards more fuel-efficient newer planes, he said. \nHigher interest rates should be good for the aviation finance sector so long as the increase does not come too quickly, he added. \n“A rising rate environment is a good thing as it generally brings with it some form of asset inflation because it is reflective of a more positive global GDP,” he said. \n“But there can be a lag before that inflation occurs and that is where you have to make sure that the business is soundly funded when you have short periods of volatility.” \nWhile some firms that entered the market in recent years due to low yields elsewhere may leave the sector if interest rates rise, others will likely move in to take advantage of the higher rates, he said. Reporting by Conor Humphries; editing by Alexander Smith\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s take a closer look at the world of aircraft leasing and why, despite some pressures, we probably won’t see a big wave of mergers or acquisitions in this sector anytime soon.\n\nAircraft leasing companies play a crucial role in the aviation industry, providing airlines with the planes they need without requiring them to buy outright. The largest player in this field is AerCap, and its CEO recently shared some insightful perspectives on where the market is headed.\n\nAt first glance, you might expect that with economic pressures on some major leasing companies, like GECAS and Avolon, there would be a rush to merge or sell. But AerCap’s CEO, Aengus Kelly, doesn’t see it that way. He points out that owners of these big leasing firms have enjoyed consistently stable returns over time. Because of that reliability, they tend to be very reluctant to sell off their assets. So while mergers and acquisitions are often talked about, Kelly doesn’t anticipate a significant surge in deals unless one company faces serious financial stress.\n\nWhen asked specifically about those two rivals—GECAS and Avolon—Kelly noted it’s hard to predict what might happen since both have been profitable. Even though General Electric, which owns GECAS, is exploring changes due to its own financial challenges, and HNA Group, Avolon’s owner, has admitted liquidity issues, these don’t necessarily mean an acquisition is imminent.\n\nKelly also touched on some broader trends affecting aviation. Fuel prices and interest rates are two key factors on the horizon. If oil prices climb higher—say from around $70 to $80 per barrel—that could put pressure on airlines’ business models. On the flip side, higher fuel costs might encourage airlines to switch to newer, more fuel-efficient planes.\n\nRegarding interest rates, a gradual increase is actually good news for aviation finance. Rising rates often reflect stronger global economic growth and can lead to asset inflation, which benefits lessors. But Kelly warns that if rates jump too quickly, it could cause short-term volatility. That’s why it’s important for companies in this space to be well-funded and prepared for these fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, despite some financial challenges faced by certain players and potential shifts in costs like fuel and interest rates, the aircraft leasing sector is expected to remain stable. Owners value their steady returns and aren’t rushing toward mergers or sales unless pushed by significant stress. So for now, it looks like the skies will stay relatively calm in this part of aviation finance."}]}

In addition, these non-IFRS measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\nNon-IFRS financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on the Company's reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial results. The non-IFRS financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, IFRS financial results.

We’ll explore how the company performed in its first quarter of fiscal 2018, breaking down key numbers and what they mean for the business.\n\nCorus reported free cash flow of $83.2 million for the quarter, which is a significant increase from $33.9 million the previous year. That’s a strong sign of cash generation, even though some other areas showed challenges.\n\nOn the revenue side, consolidated revenues were slightly down by 2 percent, totaling about $457 million compared to $468 million a year earlier. This decline was mainly driven by a weaker television advertising market. Television segment revenues fell 2 percent, with advertising revenues dropping 4 percent, while subscriber revenues remained flat. However, merchandising and distribution revenues saw a 7 percent increase, helping to soften the impact.\n\nRadio revenues stayed relatively steady, with only a small 1 percent dip in advertising revenue. Interestingly, radio segment profit actually increased by 2 percent, improving its profit margin slightly to 32 percent.\n\nOverall consolidated segment profit decreased by 7 percent to nearly $178 million, with the profit margin slipping from 41 to 39 percent. Television segment profit dropped 9 percent, bringing its margin down from 43 to 41 percent.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders rose to $77.7 million or 38 cents per share basic and diluted, up from $71.1 million or 36 cents per share last year. When adjusting for certain acquisition and restructuring costs, adjusted net income was $78.9 million compared to $80.8 million previously.\n\nDespite some headwinds in television advertising, Corus’ CEO emphasized the company’s commitment to strategic priorities and investments in content and advanced advertising initiatives. The goal is to remain competitive and well-positioned in a rapidly evolving media environment.\n\nIn summary, Corus Entertainment’s first quarter showed mixed results: strong cash flow growth and steady radio performance balanced against declines in television advertising revenue and segment profits. The company continues to focus on adapting strategically for future growth amid changing market conditions.\n\nThat wraps up our look at Corus Entertainment’s recent financial performance—a snapshot of how one media company is navigating today’s challenges while planning for tomorrow."}]}

Reporting by Rik Sharma; Editing by Toby Davis\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome back to the show. Today, we’re diving into a recent King’s Cup match where Atletico Madrid secured their spot in the quarter-finals with a convincing win.\n\nSo, what happened? Atletico faced off against Lleida Esportiu, a team from Spain’s third tier. The first half was a bit of a stalemate. Lleida held their ground well, and despite some close calls for Atletico—like Lucas Hernandez hitting the post and Diego Costa being stopped one-on-one with the goalkeeper—the score remained 0-0 at halftime. The atmosphere was quiet too, with only a small crowd at the Wanda Metropolitano stadium.\n\nBut things changed after the break. In the 57th minute, Diego Costa set up Yannick Carrasco, who calmly put the ball in the net. That goal finally gave the home fans something to celebrate. Then, about 17 minutes later, Kevin Gameiro scored following a clever assist from Angel Correa, doubling Atletico’s lead.\n\nThe finish came courtesy of Vitolo, Atletico’s new signing, who scored his first goal for the club. He made a quick run onto a through ball from Fernando Torres and sealed the 3-0 victory for Atletico on the night. When combined with the earlier leg, Atletico won 7-0 on aggregate—a solid statement as they move forward in the tournament.\n\nTo sum it up, Atletico overcame a stubborn defense from Lleida with a strong second-half performance, showing why they’re favorites in this competition. Their attacking players stepped up when it mattered, setting them up nicely for the next round.\n\nThat’s all for today’s update on the King’s Cup. Thanks for listening."}]}

(Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach, Irene Preisinger and Jan Schwartz; Writing by Maria Sheahan and Edward Taylor; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Mark Potter)\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re taking a closer look at the ongoing labor negotiations in Germany involving one of the country’s most powerful unions, IG Metall. These talks are about wages and working conditions for millions of industrial workers, and they could have significant impacts on the German economy.\n\nIG Metall represents around 3.9 million workers in the metals and engineering sectors. Right now, the union is pushing for a 6 percent wage increase, reflecting confidence in Germany’s strong economic growth and low unemployment. But that’s not all—they’re also demanding the right for workers to reduce their weekly hours from 35 to 28 if they need to care for children, elderly family members, or sick relatives, with the option to return to full-time work after two years.\n\nEmployers, on the other hand, have offered a much smaller pay rise—around 2 percent plus a one-time payment—and have rejected the call for shorter working hours unless they can also temporarily increase hours when needed. This disagreement has made it tough to find common ground.\n\nThe situation is serious enough that IG Metall had threatened all-out strikes. However, they’ve agreed to one last round of talks before deciding whether to escalate. If no agreement is reached by Saturday lunchtime, the union plans to call 24-hour strikes, which could disrupt production at major companies like BMW, Audi, and Daimler. In fact, recent stoppages have already caused hundreds of cars not to be assembled.\n\nThis push for shorter working hours is particularly notable because it’s the first major attempt since strikes in 1984 led to a reduction from 40 to 35 hours per week. So these negotiations aren’t just about pay—they’re also about work-life balance and flexibility for millions of workers.\n\nTo sum up, IG Metall is making a strong stand for better pay and more flexible working hours amid a booming economy. Employers are resisting some of these demands, especially around shorter hours. The outcome of these talks will be closely watched—not just in Germany but across Europe—because it could set important precedents for labor rights and economic policy.\n\nThat’s the latest on this developing story about labor negotiations in Germany. We’ll keep an eye on how things unfold after these crucial talks wrap up. Thanks for listening."}]}

It is currently estimated that $0.0434 per share represents net investment income and $0.0608 per share represents return of principal.\nThe Fund adopted a managed distribution plan and will make monthly distributions to common shareholders at an annual minimum fixed rate of 10%, based on the average monthly net asset value (NAV) of the Fund’s common shares. The Fund will calculate the average NAV from the previous month based on the number of business days in that month on which the NAV is calculated. The distribution will be calculated as 10% of the previous month’s average NAV, divided by 12. Management will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund’s plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the NAV of the Fund’s common shares, but there is no assurance that the plan will be successful in doing so.\nUnder the managed distribution plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution level. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s managed distribution plan.\nThe Board may amend the terms of the plan or terminate the plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund’s shareholders. The amendment or termination of the plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The plan will be subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.\nIn compliance with Rule 19a-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, shareholders will receive a notice that details the source of income for each dividend such as net investment income, gain from the sale of securities and return of principal. Please note: Determination of the actual source of the fund’s dividend can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all fund dividends will be included in the fund’s annual or semiannual reports.\nIn addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the fund’s dividends as shown on your statement. Please refer to your Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. Since each shareholder’s tax situation is unique, please consult your tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of fund distributions.\nYou may request a copy of the Fund's current Report to Shareholders by contacting Franklin Templeton’s Fund Information Department at 1-800/DIAL BEN® (1-800-342-5236) or by visiting franklintempleton.com . All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Interest rate movements and mortgage prepayments will affect the Fund's share price and yield. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in a fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund’s share price may decline. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. The Fund is actively managed but there is no guarantee that the manager's investment decisions will produce the desired results. For portfolio management discussions, including information regarding the Fund’s investment strategies, please view the most recent Annual or Semi-Annual Report to Shareholders which can be found at franklintempleton.com or sec.gov .\nFranklin Resources, Inc.

Simply put, it aims to provide shareholders with a steady stream of income by paying monthly dividends. The goal here is to deliver an annual payout that equals at least 10% of the fund’s average net asset value, or NAV, each year. To figure out the monthly dividend, the fund looks at the average NAV from the previous month and divides 10% of that amount by 12.\n\nNow, it’s important to understand that these monthly payments are not guaranteed. The fund intends to pay this fixed minimum rate regularly, but the actual distribution might come from different sources. If the fund’s investment income isn’t enough in a given month, it may distribute long-term capital gains or even return some of your original investment as part of the dividend.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the size of these distributions doesn’t necessarily tell you how well the fund is performing. The plan is designed more to provide consistent income and potentially reduce the gap between the market price and the fund’s NAV.\n\nThe fund’s board keeps an eye on this plan and can change or end it at any time without prior notice. Such changes could affect the market value of your shares. Also, each year they review whether the 10% rate still makes sense.\n\nFor tax purposes, shareholders will get detailed information about where each dividend payment came from—whether it was investment income, capital gains, or a return of principal. However, these details are finalized only at year-end, and tax treatment may differ from accounting figures. So, it’s wise to consult your tax advisor to understand how these distributions affect your personal tax situation.\n\nIn summary, the Franklin Limited Duration Income Trust uses a managed distribution plan to offer investors a steady income stream by targeting a 10% annual payout based on its asset value. While this approach aims for consistency, it involves various sources of distribution and doesn’t guarantee returns or reflect investment performance directly. Keeping informed about how such plans work can help you make better decisions about your investments."}]}

Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris.\nTrump ended Obama-era protections for such immigrants. He now says he wants to grant them a path to citizenship, but Congress has been unable to come up with a legislative solution for an issue at the center of the recent government shutdown.\n2:50 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump has told news anchors from all the major TV networks at a White House lunch that he is striving to bring the country together.\nJournalists from outlets including PBS, CNN and Fox News say Trump told the group Tuesday that there is \"tremendous divisiveness\" in the country that has existed for years.\nHe says if he could unite the country, he would consider it a great achievement.\nThe lunch is an annual White House tradition ahead of the president's State of the Union address.\nFox News host Bret Baier said on the \"The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino\" that the lunch menu featured smoked tomato soup, thyme roasted chicken and orange merengue pudding. Baier says the rest of the lunch was off the record.\n12:30 p.m.\nFour of the Supreme Court's nine justices are expected to attend the State of the Union address.\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch are expected at the speech. Roberts, Breyer and Kagan regularly attend, as do justices appointed by the president who is speaking. Trump nominated Gorsuch a year ago.\nAmong the justices who will not be in the audience, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito haven't attended a State of the Union speech in years. Alito last went in 2010, when he was captured on camera mouthing the words \"not true\" in response to President Barack Obama's criticism of the court's then new ruling in the Citizens United campaign finance case.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy's long-standing travel plans have him in California. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in Rhode Island and Justice Sonia Sotomayor is in Panama.\n12:18 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump's top economic and national security advisers help with his State of the Union address.\nA White House official says national security adviser H.R. McMaster and economic adviser Gary Cohn contributed to the speech Trump plans to deliver Tuesday night at the Capitol. The official says they were assisted by policy adviser Stephen Miller, staff secretary Rob Porter and other speechwriters.\nThe official stressed that the speech is the president's and that Trump has spent months giving his aides \"tidbits\" on lines he wants to use.\nThe White House has said Trump will use the speech to discuss economy and national security, as well as trade, immigration and infrastructure.\nThe official was not authorized to discuss internal White House deliberations by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n1:27 a.m.\nPresident Donald Trump will herald a robust economy and push for bipartisan congressional action on immigration in Tuesday's State of the Union address.\nThe speech marks the ceremonial kickoff of Trump's second year in office and is traditionally a president's biggest platform to speak to the nation. However, Trump has redefined presidential communications with his high-octane, filter-free Twitter account and there's no guarantee that the carefully crafted speech will resonate beyond his next tweet.\nStill, White House officials are hopeful the president can use the prime-time address to Congress and millions of Americans watching at home to take credit for a soaring economy. Trump argues that the tax overhaul he signed into law late last year has boosted business confidence and will lead companies to reinvest in the United States.\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s episode.

While governing might seem like running a business at first glance, Trump says the reality is much more complex because millions of people are affected by these decisions. For example, immigration isn’t just a simple business issue; it involves real lives and communities, making it far more complicated than he originally thought.\n\nOn the night of the speech, First Lady Melania Trump plans to spotlight some special guests. She’ll be sitting with Americans described as heroes who served the nation, families affected by tragedy, and people who embody the American dream. This gesture adds a personal touch to the event, especially as she has maintained a low profile recently amid personal controversies.\n\nSpeaking of guests, many Democrats invited young immigrants known as “Dreamers” to attend the address. These are individuals brought to the U.S. illegally as children, whose future has been uncertain since President Trump ended protections put in place during the Obama administration. Although Trump now supports giving them a path to citizenship, Congress has yet to find a solution—a stalemate that’s even contributed to government shutdowns.\n\nBehind the scenes, Trump met with news anchors from major networks in a traditional White House lunch before the speech. He acknowledged the deep divisions in the country and expressed hope that uniting Americans would be one of his greatest achievements. This moment highlighted his awareness of the challenges ahead.\n\nThe State of the Union also draws attention from all branches of government. Four Supreme Court justices—Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch—were expected to attend. Their presence underscores the significance of this annual event as a moment when all parts of government come together.\n\nAs for the speech itself, top advisers in economic and national security fields helped shape it. The president spent months guiding his team on key lines he wanted included. The address was set to cover economic growth, national security, trade, immigration reform, and infrastructure—topics central to his agenda.\n\nUltimately, President Trump aimed to use this prime-time platform not only to highlight what he sees as economic successes—crediting tax reforms for boosting business confidence—but also to call for bipartisan cooperation on immigration reform. While his communication style often breaks from tradition, this speech remains a pivotal moment in framing his presidency’s next chapter.\n\nTo sum up, President Trump’s first State of the Union was about more than policy—it reflected lessons learned about leadership’s human side, efforts to bridge divides, and an appeal for unity amid complex issues like immigration. It set the stage for how he intends to lead in year two.\n\nThanks for listening. Until next time."}]}

It centers on a memo created by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his team. This memo alleges some serious misconduct by the Justice Department during its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nSo, what’s the deal with this memo? Well, it’s become a point of contention among Republicans themselves. On one side, you have some members pushing for its public release, arguing that it’s important for transparency. On the other side, others are more cautious about making it public.\n\nOne key figure in this discussion is Representative Trey Gowdy from South Carolina. He helped write the memo and recently spoke about it on Fox News Sunday. Gowdy described the document as a “distilling” of information gathered from thousands of documents reviewed by the committee. Essentially, it’s a summary that aims to highlight what they see as problematic conduct by the Justice Department.\n\nInterestingly, Gowdy also pointed out that the memo doesn’t include anything that wasn’t already known to the Justice Department. This suggests that the information isn’t exactly new but is presented in a way that could influence public perception of the investigation.\n\nTo sum up, this memo is at the heart of an internal Republican debate about how to handle sensitive information related to a high-profile investigation. It raises questions about transparency, political strategy, and how such documents can shape public understanding of government actions. As this story continues to unfold, it will be important to watch how both lawmakers and the public respond to these allegations and the call for disclosure."}]}

The last game they had lost in any competition was in the Spanish Super Cup to Real Madrid on Aug. 16. \nThe second leg of the tie at the Nou Camp is on Jan. 25. \nElsewhere, Sevilla battled back from a goal down to win 2-1 at Atletico Madrid as Diego Simeone’s decision to rest number one goalkeeper Jan Oblak in favour of Miguel Angel Moya backfired. \nMoya clawed a cross into his own net in the 79th minute to cancel out Diego Costa’s arrowed strike six minutes earlier, while Joaquin Correa struck the winner in the 88th to give under-fire new Sevilla coach Vincenzo Montella a much-needed victory. \nValencia also staged a late comeback to beat last year’s runners-up Deportivo Alaves 2-1 at home. The visiting side went ahead through Ruben Sobrino in the 66th minute but Portugal international Goncalo Guedes levelled for Valencia in the 73rd. \nAlaves defender Adrian Dieguez was dismissed in the 77th for picking up two bookings in the space of nine minutes, and Valencia striker Rodrigo Moreno took full advantage by shooting off the near post eight minutes from time. \nReal Madrid visit Leganes in the other quarter-final first leg on Thursday.

Today, we're diving into some surprising moments from the King’s Cup quarter-finals that shook up Spanish football.\n\nWe’ll start with a stunning upset in Barcelona, then look at some dramatic comebacks from Sevilla and Valencia, and finish with a quick preview of another big match coming up.\n\nFirst up, the big shocker: Barcelona, the three-time defending King’s Cup champions, lost 1-0 to their city rivals Espanyol. This ended an impressive 29-game unbeaten streak for Barcelona across all competitions. The decisive moment came late in the game when Oscar Melendo, an Espanyol academy graduate, scored in the 88th minute.\n\nBut there was more drama before that goal. Lionel Messi had a penalty saved by Diego Lopez, Espanyol’s goalkeeper and former Real Madrid player, earlier in the second half. This miss was crucial because Barcelona had not lost to Espanyol since 2009, and this was their first defeat by them in the King’s Cup since 1970. Their last loss in any competition had been months earlier against Real Madrid.\n\nLooking ahead, the second leg will be played at Barcelona’s home ground on January 25th, giving them a chance to turn things around.\n\nMeanwhile, over in Madrid, Sevilla pulled off a late comeback to beat Atletico Madrid 2-1. Atletico’s coach Diego Simeone made a surprising choice to rest his star goalkeeper Jan Oblak in favor of Miguel Angel Moya. That decision backfired when Moya accidentally deflected a cross into his own net in the 79th minute, cancelling out Diego Costa’s earlier goal. Then, Joaquin Correa scored the winner just before the final whistle, giving new Sevilla coach Vincenzo Montella a much-needed boost.\n\nValencia also staged an exciting comeback at home against Deportivo Alaves. After falling behind when Ruben Sobrino scored for Alaves in the 66th minute, Valencia equalized through Goncalo Guedes just seven minutes later. Things got tougher for Alaves when defender Adrian Dieguez was sent off after two quick bookings. Taking advantage of the extra player, Valencia’s Rodrigo Moreno scored the winning goal with eight minutes left.\n\nAnd finally, looking ahead to Thursday, Real Madrid will face Leganes in another King’s Cup quarter-final first leg.\n\nSo to sum it up: Barcelona faced an unexpected defeat after Messi’s missed penalty and Melendo’s late goal gave Espanyol a rare victory. Meanwhile, Sevilla and Valencia showed resilience with late goals to secure wins. These matches remind us just how unpredictable knockout football can be.\n\nThanks for listening—stay tuned for more updates as these thrilling cup ties continue to unfold."}]}

Adam Schiff of California said on Twitter that his state, \"like Florida, has hundreds of miles of beautiful coastline and a governor who wants to keep it that way. Or is that not enough for blue states?\"\n\"If local voices matter why haven't they excluded Virginia?\" asked Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. \"Is it because the governor of Florida is a Republican and the Virginia governor is a Democrat?\"\nThe complaints came as South Carolina's Republican governor said Wednesday he is seeking an exemption from the proposed drilling expansion, a move that will test the relationship between Trump and one of his earliest supporters.\nGov. Henry McMaster told reporters that risks associated with drilling pose a serious threat to South Carolina's lush coastline and $20 billion tourism industry.\n\"We cannot afford to take a chance with the beauty, the majesty and the economic value and vitality of our wonderful coastline in South Carolina,\" McMaster said.\nOpposition to drilling is bipartisan within South Carolina's congressional delegation: All three House members who represent the state's 190 miles of coastline told The Associated Press they are against the expansion plan. Two of the three are Republicans, including Rep. Mark Sanford, a former governor who said Zinke had set a precedent by honoring Florida's request for an exemption.\n\"What's good for the goose is good for the gander,\" Sanford said, adding that Republicans should respect local wishes.\nIn Virginia, GOP Rep. Scott Taylor joined Kaine and Gov.-elect Ralph Northam in opposing the drilling plan. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., called Trump's plan \"a complete non-starter.\"\nSen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said on Twitter that \"the only science @SecretaryZinke follows is political science. He'll reverse course to protect fellow Republicans in Florida, but not to protect coastlines and jobs across the rest of the country? Totally unacceptable.\"\nHeather Swift, a spokeswoman for Zinke, accused Kaine and other Democrats of taking cheap shots at her boss.\n\"The secretary has said since day one that he is interested in the local voice. If those governors would like to request meetings with the secretary, they are absolutely welcome to do so,\" she said. \"Their criticism is empty pandering.\"\nAs of Wednesday, only McMaster and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina had requested a meeting with Zinke on offshore drilling, Swift said.\nIn Oregon, Democratic Gov. Kate Brown took to Twitter to ask Zinke for relief. Linking to Zinke tweet about Florida, Brown wrote: \"Hey @secretaryzinke, how about doing the same for #Oregon?\"\nZinke said after a brief meeting with Scott at the Tallahassee airport Tuesday that drilling in Florida waters would be \"off the table,\" despite a plan that proposed drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean off Florida.\nThe change of course — just five days after Zinke announced the offshore drilling plan — highlights the political importance of Florida, where Trump narrowly won the state's 29 electoral votes in the 2016 election and has encouraged Scott to run for Senate.\nThe state is also important economically, with a multibillion-dollar tourism business built on sunshine and miles of white sandy beaches.\nAnd Florida is where Trump has a winter home in Palm Beach. Trump spent his Christmas and New Year's break at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\nFormer White House ethics chief Walter Shaub said Zinke's decision to exempt Florida from the drilling plan appears to be a conflict of interest for Trump.\nTrump is \"exempting the state that is home to the festering cankerous conflict of interest that the administration likes to call the 'Winter White House' and none of the other affected states,\" Shaub tweeted.\nZinke said Tuesday that \"Florida is obviously unique\" and that the decision to remove the state came after meetings and discussion with Scott, a Trump ally and a likely candidate for the Senate seat now held by Democrat Bill Nelson.\nNelson called Scott's meeting with Zinke \"a political stunt\" and said Scott has long wanted to drill off Florida's coast, despite his recent opposition.\nScott's office said he repeatedly voiced his opposition to drilling to Zinke, including at an October meeting in Washington.\n\"Senator Nelson and anyone else who opposes oil drilling off Florida's coast should be happy the governor was able to secure this commitment. This isn't about politics. This is good policy for Florida,\" said John Tupps, a Scott spokesman.\nZinke announced plans last week to greatly expand offshore oil drilling from the Atlantic to the Arctic and Pacific oceans, including multiple areas where drilling is now blocked. The plan was immediately met with bipartisan opposition on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\nDemocratic governors along both coasts unanimously oppose drilling, as do a number of Republican governors, including McMaster, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Massachusetts Gov. Charles Baker.\nThe five-year plan announced by Zinke would open 90 percent of the nation's offshore reserves to development by private companies.\nIndustry groups praised the announcement, while environmental groups denounced the plan, saying it would impose \"severe and unacceptable harm\" to America's oceans, coastal economies, public health and marine life.\nAssociated Press writers Meg Kinnard in Columbia, S.C., Ben Finley in Norfolk, Va., and Gary Fineout in Tallahassee, Fla., contributed to this report.\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let’s talk about a heated debate unfolding along America’s coastlines—offshore drilling and the politics surrounding it. Recently, the Trump administration unveiled a plan to expand offshore oil drilling across much of the country’s coastal waters.

The Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, announced a sweeping plan to open up 90 percent of the nation’s offshore reserves to oil development. This includes areas along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic coasts—places that have long been protected from drilling. Almost immediately, governors and lawmakers from these coastal states pushed back hard.\n\nWhat makes this controversy particularly interesting is how the administration has handled requests from states to be exempted from the plan. Florida, with its Republican governor Rick Scott, successfully got its coastal waters removed from the drilling proposal. This decision has raised eyebrows because other states with Democratic governors—like California, Virginia, Oregon, and North Carolina—have asked for similar exemptions but were denied.\n\nCritics argue this shows political favoritism. They point out that Florida is not only politically important—Trump won the state narrowly in 2016 and has close ties there—but also economically vital, with a huge tourism industry built on its beaches. Opponents say it looks like the administration is protecting Florida at the expense of other states just because of party alignment.\n\nEven within Republican ranks, there’s pushback. South Carolina’s Republican governor Henry McMaster wants an exemption too, concerned about risks to his state’s $20 billion tourism economy. Some Republican members of Congress in South Carolina and Virginia have joined Democrats in opposing the drilling expansion.\n\nThe Interior Department says it values local voices and invites governors to meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss concerns. But so far, only two governors have requested such meetings.\n\nEnvironmental groups warn that expanding offshore drilling could cause severe damage to marine life, public health, and coastal economies. On the other hand, industry supporters praise the plan for boosting energy development.\n\nSo what’s the takeaway? This offshore drilling debate isn’t just about energy policy—it’s wrapped up in politics, local economies, and environmental concerns. The decision to exclude Florida while including other states has intensified accusations of partisanship and favoritism. As this unfolds, it highlights how complex balancing national energy goals with local interests can be.\n\nIn the end, whether or not offshore drilling expands depends not just on natural resources but on political will and public pressure along America’s coasts. It’s a story worth watching closely as it develops."}]}

LORDS SCRUTINY \nThe upper house, the House of Lords, will now begin months of scrutiny of the bill before it can become law. Any changes made by the lords will require approval from the lower house, and the whole process could take until May to complete. \nThe House of Lords contains a diverse, largely unelected, mix of political appointees, experts, and members who inherited their positions. Many lords are opposed to Brexit. \nSome of those figures are expected to try to soften the Brexit approach to include remaining in the EU’s single market or a second public vote, but the most likely areas for changes involve technical and constitutional issues. \nMay has ruled out a second vote and says Britain will be leaving. Labour’s Corbyn is also committed to following through with Brexit, albeit pushing for different priorities and aims. \nNevertheless, calls for a second referendum are expected to persist, particularly as both pro- and anti-EU politicians have mooted the possibility recently. \nEU officials and some member states have said they would welcome a change of heart from Britain. \nBut, barring a major change of policy from one of the country’s two largest political parties, Britain remains on course to leave the bloc in March 2019. Reporting by William James; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into a key moment in the Brexit journey — the British Parliament’s approval of the government’s main Brexit legislation back in early 2018. This vote was a significant step for Prime Minister Theresa May, but it also set the stage for intense political battles ahead.\n\nSo, what exactly happened? On January 17, 2018, the UK’s House of Commons voted 324 to 295 in favor of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. This bill was designed to repeal the 1972 law that had made Britain a member of the EU and to convert existing EU laws into British law. The goal was to create a clear legal framework for Britain’s exit from the EU.\n\nBrexit minister David Davis emphasized that this bill was essential to prepare the country for leaving the EU smoothly and orderly, reassuring businesses and citizens that the government was taking steps to manage the transition effectively.\n\nHowever, this victory in the Commons wasn’t the end of the story. The bill was set to face scrutiny from the House of Lords, which is largely pro-EU and where May’s party didn’t hold a majority. The Lords are expected to carefully examine the bill, potentially pushing for changes or delays that could soften Brexit or even reopen debates about a second referendum.\n\nOpposition came from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his party, who voted against the bill. Labour argued that it didn’t include enough protections for workers and consumers. Their Brexit policy chief described efforts to negotiate changes as futile.\n\nDespite these challenges, both May and Corbyn insisted they would see Brexit through — though with different priorities. May ruled out any second referendum, while calls for one continued from various quarters, including some EU officials who would welcome a change of heart.\n\nLooking ahead from that point, the process in the House of Lords could take months, with any amendments needing approval back in the Commons. But unless there was a major political shift, Britain was on track to leave the EU by March 2019.\n\nIn summary, this vote marked an important legal milestone in Brexit but also highlighted how complex and contested the path ahead would be — with Parliament’s upper house poised to play a crucial role in shaping how Britain’s departure unfolded."}]}

If you’ve been following corporate board dynamics or shareholder engagement, this is a great example of how those interactions can play out.\n\nSo, what’s going on with Obsidian Energy and FrontFour? Essentially, FrontFour Capital shared their views on where Obsidian should be headed. In response, Obsidian confirmed they are aware of these views and emphasized that their current corporate strategy has the full support of their board of directors. That’s an important point—it shows the company’s leadership is unified behind their plans.\n\nNow, FrontFour proposed some candidates for Obsidian’s board. The company took these suggestions seriously and interviewed the proposed individuals. From this process, both parties agreed to add one candidate to the board. Along with this appointment, there was a standstill agreement put in place, similar to one previously executed with another board member, Edward Kernaghan.\n\nLooking back, Obsidian received a letter from FrontFour in early October. Interestingly, many ideas in that letter were already being pursued by Obsidian for several months. Then, in mid-December, they received a second letter from FrontFour. Despite extensive negotiations following these communications, FrontFour was unwilling to execute an agreement that would allow for adding another mutually agreed-upon board member.\n\nIn summary, Obsidian Energy is maintaining its current strategy with strong board support while engaging with FrontFour Capital’s input. They managed to agree on adding one new board member but hit a roadblock in further negotiations. It’s a clear example of how companies and investors negotiate influence and direction behind the scenes.\n\nThat wraps up our look at Obsidian Energy’s recent board developments and shareholder dialogue.

Notably, he represented thousands of clients against Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, back in 2003 and secured a major settlement in 2006. Now, alongside his co-lead counsels Joseph F. Rice and Paul T. Farrell Jr., Hanly will help manage this complex case. Together, they oversee nearly 100 law firms representing plaintiffs across more than 200 related cases.\n\nThe defendants named include a broad range of pharmaceutical companies, such as Purdue Pharma and its affiliates, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries, and Endo Health Solutions, among others.

It also did not say whether the spending plan was driven by the new tax law. Apple has traditionally declined to publicly announce its spending plans. \nThe iPhone maker, whose products are mostly made in Asian factories, said it plans a wave of investing and hiring in the United States and will create 20,000 jobs through hiring at its existing campus and the new one. It will announce the location later this year. \nAbout a third of the new spending will be on data centers to house its iCloud, App Store and Apple Music services, a sign of the rising importance of subscription services to a company known for its computers and gadgets. The company has data centers in seven states and also on Wednesday broke ground on an expansion of its operations in Reno, Nevada, where local officials granted it tax breaks on a downtown warehouse. \nThe U.S spending would be a significant part of Apple’s overall capital expenditures. Globally, the company spent $14.9 billion in 2017 and expects to spend $16 billion in 2018, figures that include both U.S.-based investments in data centers and other projects and Asian investments in tooling for its contract manufacturers. \nIf Apple’s overall capital expenditures continue to expand at the same rate expected this year, the $30 billion investment in the U.S. could represent about a third of its capital expenditures over the next five years. \nThe announced tax payment was roughly in line with expectations, said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. The tax bill requires companies to pay a one-time tax on foreign-held earnings whether they intend to bring them back to the United States or not. \nApple had set aside $36.3 billion in anticipation of tax payments on its foreign cash, meaning the payment would not represent a major impact on its cash flow this quarter. \nApple also said it would boost its advanced manufacturing fund, which it uses to provide capital and support to suppliers such as Finisar Corp ( FNSR.O ) and Corning Inc ( GLW.N ), from $1 billion to $5 billion. Apple said it plans to spend $55 billion with U.S.-based suppliers in 2018, up from $50 billion last year. AMAZON VS APPLE \nApple joins Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) in scouting for a location for a second campus. Amazon finished taking applications from cities in October for its second campus. Apple has not said whether it has settled on a second campus location yet. \nCurrently, Apple’s largest U.S. operations are in Cupertino, California, at its new “spaceship” Apple Park headquarters, followed by a facility in Austin, Texas where it houses customer service agents and where contract manufacturers assemble some Mac computers. The company also employs several thousand workers and contractors in Elk Grove, California, where it has customer service agents and refurbishes iPhones. \nApple also has built its own data centers in North Carolina, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona and a recently announced project in Iowa and leases data center space in other states.

Apple recently announced plans to open a second U.S. campus and launch a massive five-year investment totaling $30 billion. Alongside this, the company will make a significant one-time tax payment of about $38 billion on its overseas cash holdings.\n\nSo, what does this all mean? First off, Apple is gearing up to spend around $350 billion in the United States over the next five years. This includes the new campus, hiring 20,000 people, and working closely with U.S.-based suppliers. While Apple hasn’t revealed exactly how much of its $252 billion in foreign cash it’ll bring back home, this spending spree is a clear sign of increased investment in the U.S. economy.\n\nAbout a third of the new investment will go toward building data centers to support services like iCloud, the App Store, and Apple Music. This highlights how important subscription services have become for a company traditionally known for its hardware like iPhones and Macs. Apple already operates data centers across seven states and is expanding its facilities in places like Reno, Nevada.\n\nApple’s total capital expenditures globally were about $15 billion in 2017 and expected to rise to $16 billion in 2018. If this growth continues, the new $30 billion U.S. investment could make up roughly a third of Apple’s spending on capital projects over the next five years.\n\nThe tax payment Apple is making comes from recent U.S. tax law changes requiring companies to pay taxes on foreign earnings regardless of whether they bring that money back to the U.S. Apple had already set aside $36 billion for this purpose, so it won’t significantly impact their cash flow this quarter.\n\nAdditionally, Apple is increasing its advanced manufacturing fund from $1 billion to $5 billion to support suppliers like Finisar and Corning. It also plans to spend $55 billion with U.S.-based suppliers in 2018, up from $50 billion last year.\n\nInterestingly, Apple joins Amazon in searching for a site for a second campus, though Apple hasn’t yet announced where it will be located. Currently, Apple’s largest U.S. operations include its headquarters in Cupertino, California, and facilities in Austin, Texas, among others.\n\nIn summary, Apple’s announcement marks a substantial commitment to investing in the United States through job creation, infrastructure development, and supplier partnerships—all backed by significant financial resources tied to recent tax law changes. It’s a clear indication that Apple is expanding its footprint on American soil while continuing to evolve its business model beyond just making devices."}]}

REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/File Photo Trump in September ordered an Obama-era program that provided the young “Dreamer” immigrants with work permits and prevented them from being deported to end in six months. The program is known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.\nDespite his order, the Republican president has vacillated in his view of the Dreamers. Young people brought to the United States as children illegally and raised and educated in the country, most of them have little or no experience of their parents’ homelands in Latin America, Asia, Africa and elsewhere.\nSaving the Dreamers is a high priority for Democrats, but the issue has been swept up in other debates, including one on the wall that Trump wants to build along the U.S.-Mexico border.\nRepublican Senator John Cornyn, in a tweet on Friday, accused Democrats of trying to force a deal on Dreamers by doing a “slow walk” on efforts to approve critical disaster aid and defense spending.\nTwo other Republicans late on Thursday said both sides remained far apart. “Our discussions on border security and enforcement with Democrats are much further apart, and that is key to getting a bipartisan deal on DACA,” senators Thom Tillis and James Lankford said in a statement.\nDemocrats have said they are open to tying DACA to additional funding for border security technology. But they oppose Trump’s wall, projected to cost over $21 billion.\nThe struggle over the Dreamers carries political weight for both parties heading into the November 2018 midterm congressional elections. Most of the Dreamers came from Mexico and Hispanics tend to vote for Democrats, who hope to gain seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives.\nRepublican lawmakers met with Trump at the White House on Thursday and initially emerged saying they were optimistic that they could find a legislative fix for DACA.\nOn Friday and Saturday, Trump and senior Republican congressional leaders are also likely to discuss the issue at a conference held at Camp David, the U.S. president’s mountain retreat in Maryland.\nA meeting between leaders of both parties was set for Tuesday.\nCornyn, in an interview on Fox News on Friday, said Trump would demand that an immigration deal address the current visa lottery system and chain migration that unites family members.\n“Those are things that he’s insisted upon,” and Democrats would have to embrace them along with border security, said Cornyn.\nAdditional reporting by Richard Cowan and Makini Brice; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Alistair Bell\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into the ongoing debate over the fate of young undocumented immigrants in the U.S., often called Dreamers. These are individuals brought to the country as children, many of whom have grown up and been educated here. Their future is uncertain, and it’s become a major point of contention in Washington.\n\nSo, what’s going on? At the heart of this issue is a program called DACA—Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. It was created during the Obama administration to give these young people work permits and protection from deportation. But in September, President Trump ordered that this program end within six months, putting about 700,000 Dreamers at risk of losing their status.\n\nNow, while saving Dreamers is a top priority for Democrats, it’s not so simple. The issue is tangled up with other debates, especially around border security and the proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Republicans say any deal on Dreamers has to include stronger border enforcement measures.\n\nSenator John Cornyn, a Republican, recently accused Democrats of slowing down progress on other critical funding bills to pressure a Dreamers deal. Meanwhile, senators Thom Tillis and James Lankford pointed out that the two parties remain far apart on border security, which they see as key to reaching an agreement.\n\nDemocrats have shown some willingness to support increased funding for border security technology but reject the idea of funding Trump’s border wall, which could cost more than $21 billion. This standoff carries significant political weight as both parties gear up for the 2018 midterm elections. Many Dreamers are from Mexico, and Hispanic voters tend to support Democrats, adding another layer to the political stakes.\n\nRecently, Republican lawmakers met with President Trump and initially seemed hopeful about finding a legislative solution for DACA. Over the weekend, Trump and Republican leaders planned further discussions at Camp David.

With SurPaaS, CIOs can quickly scan, analyze, optimize, and migrate their applications to the Cloud without spending thousands of coding hours to build what SurPaaS offers rapidly, in an automated, reliable, and consistent fashion. “\n“We are thrilled to have such a highly accomplished, insightful and proven technology leader join Corent as we are about to embark on an aggressive go to market plan together with some of the key Cloud industry leaders,” said Feyzi Fatehi, Corent’s CEO.\nCorent SurPaaS automatically migrates and Cloud-enables any software application as fully instrumented SaaS for efficient delivery ‘as a Service,’ saving years and millions of dollars worth of manual design and programming effort. SurPaaS was named the most Innovative Cloud Service and was recognized by the Gartner Group for its innovative approach for rapid delivery of conventional software as fully instrumented SaaS (Software as a Service). Corent was recently awarded a patent for its consequential invention of “Software Defined SaaS ® ” platform.\nAbout Jim Dubois\nSince 2013 Jim DuBois served as Corporate Vice President and Chief Information Officer (CIO) at Microsoft Corporation until late 2017. He was responsible for the company's global security, infrastructure, IT messaging, and business applications. Since joining Microsoft in 1993, he served various other roles in Microsoft including leading IT teams for application development, infrastructure and service management and as Microsoft's Chief Information Security Officer. Before joining Microsoft, Mr. DuBois worked for Accenture, focusing on financial and distribution systems. In 2017, Mr. DuBois authored “Six-Word Lessons on How to Think Like a Modern-Day CIO” - a highly acclaimed book that gives 100 practical lessons on thriving in a fast-paced tech world of digital transformation and effective use of technology to drive business value.\nAbout Corent\nCorent Technology, Inc. is the provider of SurPaaS platform - the emerging platform for Cloud migration and management. Corent is managed by a team of Silicon Valley veterans from Microsoft, IBM, HPE, Cisco, EMC, Oracle, and WMware among others.

Imagine a way to move your company’s existing software applications to the cloud without the massive effort of rewriting or re-architecting them. Sounds like a game changer, right? Well, that’s exactly what Corent Technology is doing with their innovative SurPaaS platform.\n\nCorent has just welcomed Jim DuBois as a senior advisor. Now, Jim is no stranger to the tech world—he’s a global IT veteran and was most recently the Chief Information Officer at Microsoft. His experience spans decades, including leadership roles in security, infrastructure, and application development. He even authored a book on how modern CIOs can thrive in today’s fast-moving digital landscape.\n\nSo, what does Corent bring to the table? Their SurPaaS platform disrupts the traditional way companies move applications to the cloud. Typically, migrating on-premise software to cloud-based services involves extensive coding and redesign. But SurPaaS automates this process. It scans, analyzes, optimizes, and migrates applications quickly and reliably. This means CIOs can convert their software into fully functional Software as a Service—or SaaS—without spending thousands of hours on manual coding.\n\nThis approach not only saves time but also cuts costs significantly. Corent’s technology has been recognized for its innovation, even earning accolades from Gartner and securing a patent for what they call their “Software Defined SaaS” platform.\n\nWith Jim DuBois advising them, Corent is gearing up for an aggressive market push alongside major cloud industry players. His insight and leadership are expected to accelerate Corent’s growth as they help businesses break free from outdated data center architectures.\n\nTo sum it up, Corent’s SurPaaS is simplifying cloud migration by automating the transformation of existing software into scalable SaaS solutions. And with seasoned experts like Jim DuBois on board, this technology is poised to make a significant impact on how enterprises embrace the cloud.\n\nThat’s all for today’s look at innovation in cloud migration.

It’s a big moment for any company, signaling growth and new opportunities.\n\nAt the same time, Jacob Meldgaard, CEO and executive director of Torm PLC, was ringing the opening bell at the Nasdaq. These ceremonies are more than just tradition—they symbolize confidence and a fresh start on the trading day for these companies.\n\nSo, in summary, today’s spotlight is on leadership and new beginnings in the financial markets. David Lopez celebrated PlayAGS’s IPO at the NYSE, while Jacob Meldgaard represented Torm PLC at the Nasdaq. Both moments highlight how companies mark their progress and presence in the market.\n\nThanks for tuning in. We’ll keep bringing you updates that matter in business and finance."}]}

The office’s stated goal is to protect institutions and people who refuse to provide medical assistance based on religious objections. It’s a new division, but an old—and dangerously discriminatory—approach to health care. \nAlthough the administration claims the new office is intended to protect religious beliefs, it will almost surely function to license discrimination against women, LGBT people, and others. Among those the administration wants to protect with today’s announcement are those who refuse to provide abortions. There was, naturally, no mention of the harm to women that results when hospitals refuse to provide abortions or referrals for abortions. Nor was there talk of what happens to women when nurses protest providing women care before and after abortion, as we have seen some do. \nSee also: Commentary: ‘Religious Liberty’ Is Not an Excuse to Deny Transgender People Medical Care \nThere was also no discussion of how the new division opens the door for health care workers and institutions to discriminate against transgender people, but there is reason to fear that’s just what they intend to do. The Trump administration has already taken protections away from trans students, trans service members, and trans employees. And anti-transgender advocates, who now have significant influence in the White House, have made it clear that a significant part of their agenda is to deprive transgender patients of essential, medically necessary health care. The new division could be one way to further this goal. \nMedical standards, not religious beliefs or moral convictions, should guide our health care policies. No one should be turned away when they need medical help. No one should be humiliated, demeaned, and left to suffer because of who they are or the health care they need. \n\nWhile Donald Trump and his administration may claim that initiatives such as this promote liberty, we know the opposite is true. The specifics of what this new division will do are still murky, but the principle of the law has been clear for a long time. Freedom of religion is at the core of our national fabric and our Constitution. But that freedom does not give anyone a right to harm others, including by way of an exemption from our nation’s laws that bar discrimination and that protect our health. Liberty doesn’t involve denying a patient needed health care. Freedom doesn’t include refusing to provide patients medical care based on the sex they were assigned at birth. \nWe don’t yet know how the work of this new division will play out. But we will be watching. And should the administration choose to move forward to implement a discriminatory policy, we will see them in court. \nLouise Melling is the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into a recent move by the Trump administration that’s raising serious questions about healthcare and discrimination. Specifically, the creation of a new division within the Department of Health and Human Services called the “Conscience and Religious Freedom” division.\n\nSo, what is this division all about? The administration says its goal is to protect individuals and institutions that refuse to provide certain medical services based on religious objections. On the surface, that might sound like a way to safeguard religious beliefs. But when you look closer, it becomes clear this new office could effectively allow discrimination against women, LGBTQ people, and others who rely on medical care.\n\nFor instance, one key group this division aims to protect includes those who refuse to provide abortions. What’s missing from the conversation is any acknowledgment of the real harm this causes—when hospitals deny abortions or even referrals, or when nurses refuse care before and after abortions. This isn’t just about beliefs; it’s about access to essential healthcare.\n\nAnother major concern is how this division might impact transgender people. The Trump administration has already rolled back protections for transgender students, service members, and employees. Anti-transgender advocates have significant influence right now and have made it clear they want to limit access to necessary medical care for transgender patients. This new division could be a tool to further those efforts.\n\nAt its core, healthcare policy should be guided by medical standards, not personal religious or moral beliefs. No one should be denied care or subjected to humiliation because of who they are or what health services they need. While the administration frames this as protecting liberty, true freedom doesn’t mean refusing someone vital medical care or discriminating based on sex assigned at birth.\n\nWe don’t yet know exactly how this new division will operate in practice. But it’s something many are watching closely. If discriminatory policies are implemented, expect legal challenges ahead.\n\nIn short, protecting religious freedom is important—but it should never come at the cost of denying people the healthcare they need and deserve."}]}

McMaster has been the most vocal of Trump’s aides arguing for a more active military approach, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the military leadership have urged caution, stressing the need to exhaust diplomatic options, according to five officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nA White House National Security Council official said the administration was “constantly developing a range of options, both military and non-military” but declined to address any differences between senior aides.\nThe Pentagon declined comment on internal discussions, though one spokesman said Mattis had stressed in public that the effort to confront the North Korean crisis was diplomatically led. The State Department referred to Tillerson’s statements on the need to pursue diplomacy backed by strong military options.\nAccording to the narrative put forth by those advocating a tougher response, a strike could be limited to a single target with the aim of making Kim see reason, not to topple his government, something North Korea’s neighbor and only major ally, China, would not countenance, the officials said.\n“Trump is convinced the only thing Kim understands and respects is a punch in the face, which he thinks no previous administration has had the guts to do,” one U.S. official said.\n“At a minimum, he thinks that warning the Chinese about a preemptive strike would motivate Beijing to force Kim to shut down the programs that threaten the U.S.,” the official said.\nIt remains unclear whether these disclosures by people close to the internal deliberations were simply psychological warfare aimed at sowing strategy-changing fear within the North Korean leadership or reflected Trump’s serious intent.However, the administration’s debate on whether to put greater emphasis on strike plans has slowed because of the North-South contacts and February’s Winter Olympics to be hosted by South Korea. Pyongyang said it would send a delegation.\nSome U.S. officials have suggested that North Korea was using diplomatic overtures to try to drive a wedge between Washington and ally Seoul and did not intend to engage seriously. The South and the United States are technically still at war with the North because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.\nA new dawn: tmsnrt.rs/2Ar8lUu\n‘WHO KNOWS WHERE IT LEADS?’\nTrump’s public response to the intra-Korean meeting has been mostly positive though at times tinged with skepticism.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson concludes his remarks on the U.S.-Korea relationship during a forum at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, U.S. December 12, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo “Who knows where it leads?” he told reporters on Wednesday after discussing the talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a long-time advocate of dialogue with Pyongyang and whose capital Seoul could be devastated in any major conflict.\nTrump, who has exchanged insults and threats with Kim in recent months, was Quote: d on Thursday as telling the Wall Street Journal in an interview: “I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.” Trump offered no details and asked whether he had spoken with Kim, said: “I don’t want to comment on it. I‘m not saying I have or I haven‘t.”\nThe administration had been due to hold a Cabinet-level meeting this week to sharpen its economic and military options for dealing with North Korea.\nBut officials say this discussion has been postponed until after the Paralympic Games, which follow the Olympics and end in March, given the intra-Korean talks and a planned 20-country meeting on North Korea hosted by Canada next week.\nThe Vancouver meeting, aimed at increasing the U.S.-led pressure campaign against Pyongyang, was announced by Washington just after North Korea’s last intercontinental ballistic missile test in late November.\nOne U.S. official said one option would be to bomb a North Korean missile or nuclear facility based on a “high confidence” intelligence assessment that North Korea planned another test. Such a strike could be triggered by evidence that North Korea was fueling an ICBM, the official said. Another option would be a retaliatory strike on an ICBM or nuclear site after a test, another official said.\nThe officials said McMaster has argued that if China were assured that a strike would be limited to one target and not the beginning of a campaign to overthrow Kim, an all-out war could be avoided.\nChinese political experts said China was opposed to even limited strikes.\nHowever, Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing, said China’s attitude might change if North Korea launched a nuclear-tipped ICBM into the Pacific Ocean or fired missiles toward Guam.\nChina sees the Trump administration’s discussion of military options as a psychological game to force Beijing and Moscow to maintain pressure on Pyongyang, but they were making crisis preparations just in case, Zhao said.\n“Even if Trump is not really serious about a military strike, there is always the risk of miscalculation or an over-reaction from North Korea,” Zhao said.\nA South Korean official said Seoul believed the chance of a U.S. strike was still low. “President Trump is aware of the consequences. He’s been advised by a lot of agencies and departments of the damage it would cause and the number of victims,” the official said.\nThe prevailing view at the State Department is that military action is not worth the huge risk, a senior U.S. official said.\nHowever, the official said, “there are military options that could achieve benefits we consider in our national interest at a cost we are willing to bear.”\nThe consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies is Kim is convinced Washington seeks to overthrow him and only a nuclear arsenal can deter that.\nA Japanese ruling party lawmaker said he did not believe the Korean talks could narrow the gap between North Korea’s demand for recognition as a nuclear-armed state and the U.S. refusal to accept that.\n“It may be dangerous after the Olympics,” the lawmaker said.\nReporting by David Brunnstrom, Matt Spetalnick, John Walcott and Phil Stewart in Washington,; Josh Smith, Hyonghee Shin and Soyoung Kim in Seoul, Christian Shepherd in Beijing and Nobohiro Kubo and Linda Sieg in Tokyo; editing by Grant McCool\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s episode, where we’re diving into the complex dynamics unfolding on the Korean Peninsula ahead of the Winter Olympics. Recent talks between North and South Korea have eased some immediate fears of conflict, but the bigger picture remains uncertain.\n\nSo, what’s really going on here? We’ll explore the recent diplomatic developments, the internal debates within the U.S. administration about how to handle North Korea’s nuclear threat, and what this all might mean moving forward.\n\nFirst, let’s start with the good news. For the first time in over two years, North and South Korea held talks that have softened tensions—at least temporarily. Pyongyang even announced it would send a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea. This thaw in relations has somewhat calmed worries about an imminent war sparked by North Korea’s advancing nuclear missile capabilities.\n\nHowever, beneath this diplomatic surface, things are more complicated. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has not shown any willingness to abandon his nuclear weapons program, which he views as essential to his regime’s survival. Meanwhile, inside the U.S. government, there’s a sharp divide over how to respond.\n\nOn one side, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and others advocate for a stronger military stance, including the possibility of a limited preemptive strike aimed at convincing Kim to change course. The idea is that a targeted strike might send a clear message without triggering full-scale war—and could even pressure China to rein in North Korea.\n\nOn the other hand, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and much of the military leadership urge caution. They emphasize exhausting diplomatic options first because any military action carries enormous risks, including widespread devastation and loss of life.\n\nPresident Trump’s stance seems somewhat mixed—he has expressed both skepticism and optimism about the talks, even hinting at a personal rapport with Kim Jong Un without providing details. His administration was preparing to sharpen economic and military strategies but has delayed major decisions until after the Paralympic Games and an upcoming international meeting focused on North Korea.\n\nChina remains firmly opposed to any military strikes but might reconsider if North Korea escalates by testing nuclear-tipped missiles near its territory or allies. Analysts view some of the U.S. discussions about military options as psychological tactics aimed at pressuring China and Russia while preparing for worst-case scenarios.\n\nIn summary, while recent inter-Korean dialogue offers a hopeful pause in tensions, the fundamental issues remain unresolved. North Korea continues to pursue its nuclear arsenal; Washington wrestles with how hard to push back without sparking disaster; and regional players watch closely for what comes next.\n\nThat wraps up our look at this delicate moment on the Korean Peninsula—where diplomacy and deterrence hang in a fragile balance just ahead of the Olympic spotlight.

Recently, the company announced plans to close one of its factories in Toronto. This factory employs around 380 people, and the closure is tied to a broader shift in the company’s sales and production strategies.\n\nSo what’s behind this decision? Campbell Soup has been facing declining sales in its traditional canned soup products across North America. At the same time, other factories are becoming more efficient, which means fewer facilities are needed to meet demand. To adapt, Campbell is shifting its focus toward snacks and refrigerated foods—areas where there’s more growth potential.\n\nIn short, while the company moves away from some of its classic soup lines, it’s investing in new product categories to stay competitive and meet changing consumer preferences. This transition reflects how even well-established brands need to evolve in response to market trends.\n\nTo sum up, Campbell Soup’s factory closure in Toronto highlights the challenges of declining canned soup sales and the company’s strategic pivot toward snacks and refrigerated foods. It’s a clear example of how businesses adjust operations to keep pace with changing tastes and efficiencies."}]}

After securing registration from the relevant authorities, Aspen decided to formalize this strategic review. They’re considering a range of possibilities—this could mean bringing in a strategic partner who might help unlock more value or other options that fit their goals.\n\nTo guide them through this process, Aspen has appointed Centerview Partners UK LLP as their financial advisor. This partnership will help Aspen navigate the complexities of the review and make well-informed decisions.\n\nIn summary, Aspen Pharmacare is actively assessing how best to develop and grow its global nutritionals business, with several strategic options on the table. The involvement of a financial advisor signals their commitment to finding the right path forward. It’s a clear example of how companies adapt and seek new opportunities in specialized markets."}]}

Everyone is freaking out in the hotel,” Steve Wheatcroft tweeted at 8.14 A.M. local time (1814 GMT). \nAnother player, J.J. Spaun, took refuge in his hotel basement. \n“Barely any service. Can you send confirmed message over radio or tv,” he said in a tweet at 8.26 A.M. \nTwo minutes after that, John Peterson revealed the evasive steps he had taken. \n“Under mattresses in the bathtub with my wife, baby and in laws. Please lord let this bomb threat not be real,” tweeted Peterson, who was tied for second place halfway through the tournament. \nPeterson and Spaun evidently took longer than Justin Thomas to receive word the warning had been sent out by mistake. \n“To all that just received the warning along with me this morning ... apparently it was a ‘mistake’ - hell of a mistake!! Haha glad to know we’ll all be safe,” Thomas, the defending champion and world number four, tweeted at the same time as Spaun. \nThe third round started on time at Waialae Country Club. Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Imagine waking up to an urgent alert warning of an incoming ballistic missile. That’s exactly what happened to some of the world’s top professional golfers during the PGA Tour’s Sony Open in Hawaii back in January 2018. \n\nToday, we’re diving into that tense moment when a false missile alert caused panic among players just hours before the third round of the tournament. We’ll walk through how the players reacted and how the situation unfolded.\n\nEarly one morning, around 8 A.M. local time, an emergency alert was mistakenly sent out across Hawaii, warning residents and visitors of an incoming ballistic missile threat. This was about three hours before the golfers were set to tee off at Waialae Country Club.\n\nThe alert sparked immediate fear and confusion. Steve Wheatcroft, one of the players, quickly tweeted about the chaos, saying everyone in his hotel was freaking out. J.J. Spaun took refuge in his hotel’s basement, trying to find some safety while struggling with limited phone service.\n\nMeanwhile, John Peterson took even more drastic measures. He and his family—his wife, baby, and in-laws—huddled under mattresses in the bathtub, hoping for safety as they waited for confirmation on whether the threat was real.\n\nIt wasn’t until a little later that players started to learn it was a false alarm. Justin Thomas, who was the defending champion at the time, tweeted relief upon hearing it was a mistake, calling it a “hell of a mistake” but glad everyone would be safe.\n\nDespite the scare, the third round went ahead as scheduled at Waialae Country Club. \n\nThis incident is a striking reminder of how quickly fear can spread in moments of uncertainty—and how important clear communication is during emergencies. For these golfers, what should have been a routine day on the course turned into a heart-pounding experience they won’t soon forget."}]}

To give one example, Vehicles at Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, have software and sensors designed to detect everything from pedestrians and cyclists to road works and other vehicles.\nRide-hailing powerhouse Uber is also looking to make a mark in the self-driving market. \"In 2019, we've committed to buy 24,000 Volvo SUVs that we're going to equip with our autonomous driving technology and start to roll out on the Uber app,\" Fred Jones, the business' head of cities in the U.K. and Ireland, told CNBC.\nAutonomous vehicles will not only change the way we get around our cities. Their economic impact will also be significant. The U.K. government, for instance, has said that the driverless technology market is set to be worth as much as £50 billion to the economy by 2035.\nAs the way we drive undergoes a transformation, regulations will have to be modified. Unsurprisingly, that is going to be a big, big job.\n\"There are no rules right now, international rules, on how to regulate automated vehicles,\" Philippe Crist, project manager for the International Transport Forum (ITF), told CNBC.\n\"The safety regulation of automated vehicles will have to be the same as for regular vehicles, using the same principles.\" The ITF is an intergovernmental organization at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nThe \"object\" of regulation, Crist explained, may change. Before, it was a driver and their vehicle. Now, it would need to include the algorithms and code that operate in an autonomous one.\nHe added that future regulation would also include, to a certain extent, \"the fitness of the sensor systems that are providing input to the vehicle (and) replacing human eyes and human ears.\" This was a new space for regulation, he said.\nAnd, as the way we drive morphs from using our hands to using smart, autonomous vehicles, Crist pointed to another striking development taking place.\n\"One of the things we've seen is the knowledge about what's taking place on the streets, on roads, has shifted from the public sector to the private sector,\" he said.\n\"Now, instantaneously, several companies know better what's happening on city streets, and public authorities who are mandated to manage those streets and manage transport infrastructure and investment don't have that insight.\"\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Driverless cars are no longer just a futuristic idea—they’re quickly becoming a real part of our daily lives. Today, we’re diving into how self-driving vehicles are shaping the future of transportation, the economy, and even the rules that keep our roads safe.\n\nBig tech companies are racing to develop smarter autonomous vehicles. Take Waymo, for example—a company under Alphabet. Their cars use advanced software and sensors to spot everything from pedestrians and cyclists to roadworks and other cars. It’s all about creating a vehicle that can understand and react to its surroundings just like a human driver would.\n\nUber is also jumping into the driverless game. Back in 2019, they committed to buying 24,000 Volvo SUVs equipped with their own autonomous driving technology. These cars are set to appear on the Uber app, changing how we hail rides and move around cities.\n\nBut this isn’t just about convenience. The economic impact is huge. The UK government estimates that by 2035, the driverless technology market could add as much as £50 billion to the economy. That’s a big shift that goes beyond just getting from point A to point B.\n\nWith all these changes, regulations will need a serious update. Right now, there aren’t any international rules on how to manage automated vehicles. Philippe Crist from the International Transport Forum explains that safety regulations will have to align with those for regular cars but also consider new elements—like the software algorithms and sensor systems that replace human senses in autonomous cars.\n\nThis means regulators will have to rethink what they oversee. Instead of just focusing on drivers and vehicles, they’ll need to look closely at the technology inside these cars—how it works and how reliable it is.\n\nAnother interesting shift Crist points out is about knowledge of what’s happening on our roads. Traditionally, public authorities managed traffic and infrastructure because they had the data. Now, private companies running these smart vehicles often have better, real-time insights into street conditions than public agencies do.\n\nSo, driverless cars are more than just a new way to travel—they’re transforming technology, economics, regulation, and even who holds the key information about our streets.\n\nIn short, as self-driving technology advances, it’s reshaping not only how we move but also how cities operate and governments regulate safety. The road ahead is certainly exciting—and complex."}]}

Today, let’s talk about how recent political developments in the U.S. have influenced the value of the dollar.\n\nLast Friday, the U.S. government officially shut down because Democrats and Republicans couldn’t agree on funding. This kind of shutdown happens when Congress fails to pass a budget or a temporary funding measure, and it can cause uncertainty in financial markets.\n\nBut on Monday, things started to shift. Republican leaders in the Senate managed to gather enough support to move forward with a stopgap funding bill aimed at ending the shutdown. Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer expressed optimism that the government would reopen within a few hours.\n\nSo, what did this mean for the dollar? Well, earlier on Monday, the dollar had dipped against a basket of major currencies, reflecting some of the uncertainty caused by the shutdown. The dollar index, which measures its strength against six major currencies, had fallen but then pared those losses as news of the funding bill spread.\n\nInterestingly, while the dollar slipped slightly overall, it actually rose against the Japanese yen, reaching a four-day high. This shows how currency movements can vary depending on different factors and market reactions.\n\nIn summary, the political stalemate initially weighed on the dollar, but progress toward reopening the government helped stabilize it. It’s a reminder of how closely currency markets watch political developments and respond quickly to changes in expectations.\n\nThat’s a quick look at how government funding talks can ripple through financial markets and affect something as fundamental as the value of the dollar.

(NYSE: ALG) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared its quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share, payable January 29, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 16, 2018. This represents a 10% increase in the dividend over the $0.10 per share paid in the comparable period in 2017.\nAlamo Group is a leader in the design, manufacture, distribution and service of high quality equipment for infrastructure maintenance, agriculture and other applications. Our products include truck and tractor mounted mowing and other vegetation maintenance equipment, street sweepers, snow removal equipment, excavators, vacuum trucks, other industrial equipment, agricultural implements and related after-market parts and services. The Company, founded in 1969, has approximately 3,300 employees and operates 2 plants in North America, Europe, Australia and Brazil as of September 30, 2017. The corporate offices of Alamo Group Inc. are located in Seguin, Texas and the headquarters for the Company's European operations are located in Salford Priors, England.\nThis release contains that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause the Company's actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Among those factors which could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: market demand, competition, weather, seasonality, currency-related issues, and other risk factors listed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update the information contained herein, which speaks only as of this date.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alamo-group-inc-declares-and-increases-regular-quarterly-dividend-300575385.html\nSOURCE Alamo Group Inc.\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s take a closer look at a recent announcement from Alamo Group, a company known for its role in manufacturing equipment used in infrastructure maintenance and agriculture.\n\nAlamo Group’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 11 cents per share, set to be paid on January 29, 2018. This is notable because it marks a 10% increase from the 10 cents per share dividend paid during the same period last year. Shareholders who own stock as of January 16, 2018, will be eligible for this payment.\n\nNow, who exactly is Alamo Group? They’re a well-established company, founded back in 1969, with about 3,300 employees. Their products cover a wide range — from truck and tractor-mounted mowing equipment to street sweepers, snow removal machines, excavators, vacuum trucks, and other industrial and agricultural tools. Plus, they provide related parts and services after the sale.\n\nThe company operates two plants across North America, Europe, Australia, and Brazil. Their main corporate office is located in Seguin, Texas, while their European headquarters is in Salford Priors, England.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that announcements like this often come with a reminder about forward-looking statements. Basically, there are risks and uncertainties—things like market demand fluctuations, competition, weather conditions, currency changes—that could impact how the company actually performs in the future. So while this dividend increase is good news now, investors should keep those factors in mind.\n\nTo sum it up: Alamo Group has raised its quarterly dividend by 10%, reflecting confidence in its ongoing business. With a diverse product line and international presence, the company continues to support its shareholders while navigating the usual market challenges.\n\nThat’s the update on Alamo Group’s dividend increase and what it tells us about the company today."}]}

Francis suggested asking \"what star we have chosen to follow in our lives.\"\n\"Some stars may be bright, but do not point the way. So it is with success, money, career, honors and pleasures when these become our lives,\" the pope said. That path, he continued, won't ensure peace and joy.\nLater, during an appearance from his studio window overlooking St. Peter's Square, Francis told tens of thousands of faithful gathered below that some Christians prefer to live while indifferent to Jesus.\n\"Instead of conducting themselves in coherence with their own Christian faith, they follow the principles of the world, which lead to satisfying the inclinations toward arrogance, the thirst for power and for riches,\" Francis said.\nHe prayed that instead that \"the world makes progress down the path of justice and of peace.\"\nFrancis noted that some Eastern Rite Catholic and Orthodox churches are celebrating Christmas this weekend. In expressing cordial wishes to these believers, Francis added, \"May this glorious celebration be a source of new spiritual vigor and of communion among us Christians.\"\nHe also recalled the traditions such as in Poland, where many families join in processions recalling the three wise men. In some countries, Epiphany and not Christmas, is the holiday occasion to exchange gifts among loved ones.\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s reflect on some meaningful guidance from Pope Francis about what truly matters in life. During his Epiphany remarks, he offered a thoughtful challenge: to reconsider what we choose to follow and what we let define us.\n\nPope Francis reminded us that many people settle for just getting by—having health, a little money, and some entertainment. But he urged us to look beyond that, to resist making money, career success, or social status the center of our lives. Instead, he encouraged generosity—helping the poor and those in need without expecting anything in return.\n\nHe used the image of the three wise men who followed a star to find baby Jesus as a powerful metaphor. He asked us to think about what “star” guides us. Some stars may shine brightly but don’t lead us in the right direction. Success, money, honors, and pleasures can seem appealing but won’t guarantee true peace or joy.\n\nPope Francis also pointed out that some Christians live indifferent to Jesus, choosing worldly values like arrogance and the thirst for power instead of living consistently with their faith. He prayed for progress toward justice and peace in the world.\n\nFinally, he acknowledged that while many Christians celebrate Christmas now, others—like Eastern Rite Catholics and Orthodox believers—are celebrating it this weekend. He expressed hope that these celebrations bring renewed spiritual strength and unity among all Christians.\n\nSo, the key takeaway here is simple yet profound: Let’s choose to follow stars that lead us toward generosity, humility, and peace rather than chasing after success or wealth alone. That’s the path that brings true fulfillment."}]}

Andy Bromberg, the CEO of CoinList and a research scientist with the Stanford Bitcoin Group, shares some interesting insights on this topic. Despite some well-known skeptics like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon pushing back against crypto, Bromberg remains optimistic about where blockchain technology can take us.\n\nSo, what’s his perspective? First, he acknowledges the criticism but doesn’t let it overshadow the bigger picture. Blockchain, at its core, is more than just a platform for cryptocurrencies. It offers a way to securely and transparently record information across many industries. This could mean big changes in how we handle everything from finance to supply chains and even voting systems.\n\nBromberg sees tremendous potential for blockchain to improve efficiency and trust in these areas. By providing a decentralized system, it reduces the need for middlemen and opens up new opportunities for innovation. While some remain skeptical, Bromberg’s position highlights that blockchain’s value isn’t limited to digital currencies alone.\n\nIn short, despite doubts from some financial heavyweights, blockchain technology holds promising possibilities across various sectors. It’s worth paying attention to how this technology continues to evolve and impact our world beyond just crypto trading."}]}

Yesterday, I felt better and wanted to play. However, during the match today the pain has been there all the time but I wanted to compete.”\nThe Wimbledon champion accepted a wildcard into the tournament after retiring with leg cramps during her opening match at the Brisbane International last week and called for a medical timeout after just three games against Bertens.\nMuguruza, however, returned to the Ken Rosewall Arena and appeared to be moving freely, initially allaying fears of another injury setback by overcoming a woman who had beaten her in straight sets in their three previous meetings.\n”Since the start I felt a little bit my adductor,“ Muguruza said after registering her first win of the season. ”I already felt it in Brisbane, so I thought I was going to be much better, but it came back.\n”You always have to adapt... Sometimes you don’t need to have a pain. You just want to play a certain style of game or some tactic.\n“I figured out that being a little bit more aggressive, shorter points, that might help me and might help me also for my game. So it’s like a winning situation.”\nMuguruza’s withdrawal allows Daria Gavrilova a direct route to the semi-finals after the Spaniard’s scheduled last eight opponent won an all-Australian clash against Samantha Stosur 6-4 6-2.\nElsewhere, Agnieszka Radwanska, the 2013 champion and last year’s losing finalist in Sydney, kept her preparations for the year’s first grand slam on track with a 7-6(4) 6-0 win over teenage American qualifier CiCi Bellis.\nThe Polish 28-year-old will meet Camila Giorgi for a place in the last four after the Italian qualifier ousted twice Wimbledon and former Sydney champion Petra Kvitova 7-6(7) 6-2.\nGiorgi, belying her ranking of 100th in the world, beat U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in the first round and added another grand slam champion to her list of victims in just under two hours when Kvitova blasted a forehand wide.\nIn the men’s draw, Italian veteran Paolo Lorenzi ousted top seed Albert Ramos-Vinolas of Spain in the second round.\nRamos-Vinolas needed treatment for a leg problem early in the second set and fell 6-3 7-5 to the 36-year-old Lorenzi, who is ranked 45 in the world.\nReporting by Sudipto Ganguly; Editing by John O'Brien\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome back to the show. Today, we’re talking about some unexpected twists in the lead-up to the Australian Open, focusing on Garbine Muguruza and a few other notable players making headlines.\n\nGarbine Muguruza, currently ranked world number three, had her plans shaken up when she withdrew from the Sydney International due to a leg injury. This came just hours after she fought hard to beat Kiki Bertens in her opening match. Despite winning 6-3, 7-6, Muguruza was dealing with persistent pain in her right thigh, specifically her adductor muscle, which she had been feeling since she started practicing in Sydney.\n\nShe explained that although she felt better yesterday and wanted to compete, the pain never really went away during the match. After consulting with WTA doctors and her team, she made the tough decision to pull out before her quarter-final match. Interestingly, Muguruza had accepted a wildcard to this tournament after retiring early at Brisbane due to leg cramps, so this injury has been a bit of a nagging issue.\n\nDuring the match against Bertens, Muguruza even called for a medical timeout after just three games but managed to keep moving well enough to secure the win. She mentioned adapting her style of play to be more aggressive and keep points shorter as a way to manage the pain—an approach she felt could still help her game.\n\nHer withdrawal means that Daria Gavrilova moves directly into the semi-finals without having to face Muguruza. Gavrilova had just won an all-Australian clash against Samantha Stosur, making her run in Sydney even more impressive.\n\nMeanwhile, Agnieszka Radwanska, who won Sydney back in 2013 and was last year’s finalist, continued her solid preparation for the Australian Open. She defeated teenage American qualifier CiCi Bellis with a 7-6, 6-0 win and will next face Camila Giorgi. Giorgi has been having a remarkable tournament herself, beating high-profile players like US Open champion Sloane Stephens and former Sydney champion Petra Kvitova.\n\nOn the men’s side, there was an upset as well. Paolo Lorenzi, an experienced Italian player ranked 45th in the world, knocked out top seed Albert Ramos-Vinolas of Spain. Ramos-Vinolas struggled with a leg problem during their match and ultimately fell 6-3, 7-5.\n\nSo as we see it here, injuries have played a big role in shaping this tournament’s narrative, with Muguruza’s withdrawal being particularly significant given her status as a top contender.

Italy’s budget deficit came in at 2.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 and was below that level last year, according to Italy’s central bank.\n“The 3 percent deficit rule can be a debatable one, but we intend on respecting it,” Berlusconi told reporters in Brussels.\nOpinion polls show the centre-right grouping involving Berlusconi is in the lead ahead of an election on March 4. (Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek, writing by Philip Blenkinsop)\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about Italy’s approach to its budget deficit and what a key political figure has recently said about it.\n\nFormer Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia party, has made a clear statement regarding Italy’s fiscal policy. With national elections approaching, his party is promising to respect the European Union’s rules on budget deficits if they come to power.\n\nNow, what exactly does that mean? The EU has set a limit on how much member countries can allow their public sector deficits to reach—specifically, no more than 3 percent of their gross domestic product, or GDP. This rule is designed to encourage financial discipline and stability across the union.\n\nItaly’s budget deficit has been within this limit in recent years. In 2016, it was recorded at 2.5 percent of GDP, and last year it remained below that 3 percent threshold, according to data from Italy’s central bank.\n\nBerlusconi acknowledged that the 3 percent deficit rule can be debated, but emphasized his party’s intention to respect it. This commitment is significant because it signals a willingness to maintain fiscal responsibility while addressing Italy’s economic challenges.\n\nWith the center-right coalition, including Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, leading in opinion polls ahead of the March 4 election, their stance on budget discipline could shape Italy’s economic policies moving forward.\n\nIn summary, Italy is poised to continue adhering to the EU’s budget deficit limit under potential new leadership, highlighting a balance between national priorities and European fiscal rules."}]}

FILE PHOTO: Donald Fehr, executive director of the National Hockey League Players Association, speaks at a news conference in New York September 12, 2012. REUTERS/Eric Thayer \nWhen the NHL dangled Pyeongchang participation in front of the NHLPA in exchange for an extension of the current CBA the proposal was flatly rejected. \n“From my personal standpoint not only do the players want to participate in it but I think that participation in the Olympic Games, if it is handled right, is a very significant potential marketing and exposure opportunity for NHL players and therefore NHL hockey,” said Fehr. “I would hope that we get to the point where that is recognised.” \nWhile the NHL saw little upside in shutting down operations for almost three weeks to accommodate Olympic participation, the 2022 Beijing Games represent a gateway into the Chinese market. \nTo grow hockey in China the NHL will need infrastructure and the Chinese government and businesses have already displayed a keen interest in helping the cause by building ice rinks. \n”I guess they (NHL) are a little late to the (China) party but better to do it right than do it fast,“ David Carter, executive director at the USC Sports Business Institute and a member of the Los Angeles Kings advisory board, told Reuters. ”They would more likely look back and rue the day they didn’t figure this thing out than looking back and saying it was a wise move to forego the Games. \n”It is a big market to penetrate and it is something that has captivated people in sport business for awhile. \n“But that doesn’t get you anywhere unless the home country is willing to spend time, money and invest capital in it.” \nThe key to getting the NHL back on board for the 2022 Games will not be as simple as the lure of tapping into a new market. \nThe NHL has long bristled at paying for the privilege of competing at the Olympics while, in their view, getting very little in return beyond the prestige and a two-week global platform for their product. \n”China is a completely different economic opportunity than South Korea,“ Neal Pilson, head of Pilson Communications and former president of CBS Sports, told Reuters. ”There was really no way to figure out any possible benefit for the NHL allowing its players to play in South Korea but the league could negotiate a much better deal for its ownership when you are talking about teams, the league, the sport growing in \nChina. \n”I know they are thinking about how they can develop hockey in that nation. \n“China is a huge opportunity for the NHL.” Editing by Frank Pingue\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let’s talk about the complicated relationship between the National Hockey League and the Winter Olympics—a story that’s been unfolding for over two decades. Since 1998, the NHL has partnered with the International Olympic Committee to send its top players to the Winter Games. But that partnership hit a rough patch, leading to a break just before the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics. Today, we’ll explore why that happened and what might bring the NHL back to the Olympic ice in the future.\n\nFor five straight Winter Games, NHL players competed on the Olympic stage. But tensions grew as the league felt unappreciated and believed it was giving more than it was getting back. Negotiations became tense, with both sides trading ultimatums. Ultimately, the NHL decided its players wouldn’t participate in Pyeongchang in 2018, choosing instead to focus on its own World Cup of Hockey tournament.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee wasn’t happy about this and warned the NHL not to expect an easy invitation to future Games—especially with Beijing set to host in 2022. That’s a big deal because China represents a massive, untapped market that every major sports league wants to reach.\n\nInterestingly, even though NHL players skipped Pyeongchang, the league has already started making moves in China. They held their first exhibition games there in 2017, signaling a growing interest in expanding hockey’s footprint. The International Ice Hockey Federation president and the NHL Players Association head have both expressed a desire to see NHL players return to the Olympics. The players themselves value the chance to compete at such an elite level and appreciate the sense of patriotism that comes with representing their countries.\n\nBut getting back into the Olympics won’t be simple. It will likely be a major topic during upcoming collective bargaining talks between players and owners. The league worries about shutting down operations for nearly three weeks during the Games and has long been reluctant to pay for what it sees as limited returns beyond global exposure.\n\nStill, Beijing presents a unique opportunity. Growing hockey in China means building infrastructure, like ice rinks, and securing investment from both government and businesses. Experts note that while the NHL may be late to jump into China’s sports scene, it’s better to do it thoughtfully than rush and miss out on a huge market.\n\nIn short, while past Olympic participation ended on a sour note, there’s hope that the NHL will return by 2022—if both sides can find common ground. The combination of player enthusiasm, potential marketing benefits, and China’s massive market could finally bridge this long-standing divide.\n\nSo, when we think about hockey on the world stage, it’s clear that more than just sport is at play here—it’s about business strategy, national pride, and the future growth of hockey worldwide. The next few years will be critical in deciding whether NHL stars will once again skate under their national flags at the Olympics."}]}

Travis Kalanick, the co-founder and former CEO of Uber, is making headlines again—not for leading the company, but for a major financial step.\n\nSo what’s happening? Kalanick is selling nearly a third of his 10% ownership stake in Uber. This isn’t just a routine stock sale; it’s a deal that will officially make him a billionaire in real terms, not just on paper. That means the money from this sale will convert his stake into actual wealth he can use.\n\nTo put it simply, Kalanick helped build Uber into the global giant it is today. Even after stepping down as CEO, he held onto a significant share of the company.

According to Durbin, the president repeatedly used what he described as “vile” language and specifically referred to some African nations using a crude term—calling them “shitholes.” This confirmation came during a discussion about immigration policy and the countries involved.\n\nThis moment drew attention not just for the words themselves, but for what they represent in terms of respect, diplomacy, and how leaders talk about other nations and peoples.

The disruption occurred while the U.S. Northeast continued to endure bone-chilling weather with the New York temperature at 17 degrees Fahrenheit (-8 Celsius).\nInternational flights to Terminal 4 were temporarily suspended and passengers who had already arrived there were diverted to other terminals, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport.\nThe Port Authority said the water pipe break appears to be weather-related. Flights later resumed but with delays, it said.\nMohammed Elshamy | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images A passenger and her luggage are seen during the weather-related cancellation at the John F.

The backlog left passengers stuck on planes for long stretches while waiting for other aircraft to get in and out of gates.\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome back to the show. Today, we’re diving into a recent challenge faced by travelers at one of the busiest airports in the world—New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. If you’ve ever been caught in travel chaos, you’ll want to hear this story.\n\nSo, what happened at JFK? Over the weekend, a water main break caused flooding inside Terminal 4, leading to a temporary suspension of some flights. This incident came on the heels of a severe winter storm that had already disrupted hundreds of flights and left many passengers stranded.\n\nLet’s break down the situation step by step. The flooding occurred when a water pipe feeding the terminal’s sprinkler system burst, likely due to the extreme cold weather. Water poured from the ceiling onto check-in counters and covered large areas of the floor—about three inches deep in some spots. This led to a temporary power cut in parts of the terminal as a safety precaution.\n\nBecause of this flooding, international flights that normally operate out of Terminal 4 were temporarily halted. Passengers who had already arrived there were redirected to other terminals while repairs were underway. Although flights eventually resumed, delays persisted.\n\nThis all happened during a particularly cold stretch, with temperatures around 17 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 8 Celsius. The airport was still recovering from a “bomb cyclone” winter storm earlier in the week that had forced it to close for a day. When operations restarted, there was a significant backlog—over 500 flights canceled and nearly 1,400 delayed over just a few days.\n\nThe Port Authority explained that the extreme cold and ongoing recovery created a cascade of issues: frozen equipment, delayed baggage handling, staff shortages, and heavier passenger loads than usual. All these factors combined to leave travelers stuck on planes and crowded in terminals.\n\nIn response, officials acknowledged that what happened was unacceptable and urged travelers to check with their airlines before heading to the airport.\n\nTo sum it up, a combination of harsh winter weather and infrastructure problems led to significant disruptions at JFK Airport. The water main break flooded Terminal 4, causing flight suspensions and delays on top of an already challenging recovery from a major snowstorm.

Chenault announced last fall that he would retire as chief executive of American Express , he has been fielding phone calls from companies looking to hire him.\nIt's not surprising. Mr. Chenault is one of the most prominent African-American chief executives in the world and the man who led American Express through 9/11 and the financial crisis. When it came to selecting his next act, he was bound to have a wide variety of choices.\nIn the last two weeks, he has announced he was joining the boards of Facebook and Airbnb. And for the last several weeks, he's been trying to keep one more secret — perhaps his biggest — about his future plans.\nMore from The New York Times:\nAmerican Express C.E.O. Ken Chenault to Step Down\nAirbnb, Edging Toward Possible I.P.O, Names Ken Chenault to Board\nTesla's Elon Musk May Have Boldest Pay Plan in Corporate History\n\"You're right,'' he said. \"I literally have been inundated,\" he reluctantly acknowledged, almost embarrassed, when we spoke Monday. \"People have talked to me about some very large companies and some digital technology companies. Obviously, I can't say from a confidentiality standpoint.\"\nThe recruiters can stop calling. On Tuesday, he will announce he has a new full-time job. Mr. Chenault, a name long synonymous with Wall Street, will soon become a staple of Silicon Valley as a venture capitalist. He will be chairman and managing director of General Catalyst Partners, one of the most successful venture firms of the past two decades, with stakes in companies like Airbnb, Snap , Stripe and Warby Parker.\nMr. Chenault 's choice to jump into the world of start-ups is more than just a business decision; to him, it is an opportunity to have a larger impact on Silicon Valley and its business culture.\nAs he assessed his opportunities, he became convinced that the tech start-up world had often come up short in meeting society's challenges.\nThis area, he said, is where he hopes he can have an impact.\nConsider Mr. Chenault some much-needed adult supervision.\n\"What I think is happening right now in the digital space is a maturation cycle and some people, as we've seen, are going to handle that well and some people are going to crash and burn,\" he said, without naming names.\nOf course, he could be talking about any of a host of companies, like Uber, Google or Facebook, the latter of which is facing a revolt among consumers and possibly regulators over the way fake news proliferates on its site.\nVenture capital firms themselves are not exempt from these problems, as my colleague Katie Benner chronicled last summer with a striking exposé of harassment by powerful investors.\n\"Given their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,'' Mr. Chenault said. \"And we do have serious problems.\"\n\"Companies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\" he added. \"Companies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\"\nMr. Chenault's management skills may be a perfect fit for the role General Catalyst needs him to fill. As start-ups are staying private longer, venture capital firms are finding that someone has to actually run the companies they invest in, to think beyond the early stages of fast growth — and a quick sale or initial public offering — and to help them scale over a decade.\n\"The median time to I.P.O. has risen dramatically over the last decade, from 4.9 years in 2006 to 8.3 years in 2016,\" according to a report from Pitchbook, a data company that tracks deals. Airbnb has been private for 10 years, Uber for nine.\nWhen Mr. Chenault joined Airbnb's board last week, a company co-founder, Brian Chesky, whom Mr. Chenault has mentored for years, wrote a note to employees announcing the appointment. \"Many companies are designed to be finite,'' Mr. Chesky wrote. \"Finite companies are focused on beating their competitors and appeasing short-term interests. But business is not finite. Unlike sports, there is no time clock, so there can be no winning or losing — there is merely surviving and innovating to endure.\"\nMr. Chenault believes there is real value in trying to influence start-ups early in their life cycle, so that patience and foresight become embedded in the DNA.\nOne problem Mr. Chenault wants to address — conspicuous to anyone paying attention, but bafflingly inconspicuous to those in the Valley — is the lack of diversity, both in gender and race, in the tech industry.\n\"Diversity in the technology digital industry is a big issue,\" he said. \"If we don't make accelerated progress in that area, it will have dire consequences for our society.\"\nIt is even worse in the venture capital industry, where there are few women and even fewer African-Americans.\nThe numbers are embarrassing and depressing: African-Americans make up only 3 percent of the venture capital work force, according to a study conducted in 2016 by the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion. Latinos represented only 4 percent of the venture capital industry.\nMr. Chenault said he has known some of founding partners at General Catalyst for more than 20 years, including David Fialkow and Joel Cutler, who have been business partners since they met as children at Camp Cedar (a summer camp in Maine that I also attended). The fund, which has some $3.75 billion, was founded in Cambridge, Mass., in 1999 and has offices in New York; Palo Alto, Calif.; and San Francisco. Mr. Chenault said he would be based in New York.\nIn addition to Facebook and Airbnb, he is also on the boards of IBM and Procter & Gamble , which gives him insight into what's going on in the economy. He acknowledged that there might be times he has to recuse himself from dealing with board issues that conflict with one of the investments General Catalyst makes.\nBut at this stage of his career, he believes a move to venture capital is the right \"vehicle'' to try to make a difference. Mr. Chenault hopes to help companies not just make long-term plans, but to think about their role in society.\n\"Venture capital firms have to be more catalytic agents of change not just in the business development,\" he said, \"but in helping change the culture in the technology digital sector so there is a greater focus on the responsibilities they have.\"\n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, let’s talk about a major shift in the world of business leadership and venture capital. Kenneth I. Chenault, one of the most prominent African-American CEOs and the man who steered American Express through some of its toughest times, is embarking on a new chapter. After announcing his retirement as CEO last fall, he’s been flooded with offers from top companies eager to bring him on board. But now, he’s made a decision that signals something bigger than just another executive role.\n\nChenault is stepping into the world of Silicon Valley startups—not as a CEO, but as a venture capitalist. Starting soon, he’ll be chairman and managing director at General Catalyst Partners, a leading venture firm known for investing in companies like Airbnb, Snap, Stripe, and Warby Parker. This move isn’t just about business for Chenault; it’s about influence and impact.\n\nHe sees an opportunity to bring much-needed maturity and perspective to the tech industry. According to Chenault, the digital space is going through a “maturation cycle,” where some companies will thrive and others may falter. He’s concerned about issues like how tech companies handle societal challenges, including diversity and responsibility. For instance, he points out that both gender and racial diversity remain sorely lacking in tech and venture capital—African-Americans make up just 3 percent of venture capital workers, with Latinos only slightly higher.\n\nChenault believes startups need to embed patience, foresight, and social responsibility into their culture early on. With companies staying private longer than ever—Airbnb has been private for ten years—venture firms must help guide these businesses beyond rapid growth toward sustainable success.\n\nHis experience as a seasoned leader could be exactly what’s needed to help startups not only succeed financially but also take on broader responsibilities to society. Chenault wants venture capital to be a force for positive change—not just fueling innovation but shaping the culture of the tech world.\n\nIn short, Kenneth Chenault’s move to General Catalyst marks more than a career change; it’s a commitment to help Silicon Valley grow up thoughtfully and inclusively, with an eye toward long-term impact. It will be interesting to see how his leadership influences this next phase of technology and business.\n\nSo, as we watch this unfold, remember this key idea: leadership in tech isn’t just about innovation or profit—it’s about responsibility and culture too. And that might just be the future Chenault is helping to build."}]}

It was a year that set some costly records, and understanding what happened helps us see the bigger picture of climate and weather challenges.\n\nSo, what made 2017 stand out? Well, according to data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, the U.S. experienced weather and climate-related disasters that added up to a record-breaking $306 billion in damages. That’s the highest cost ever recorded for a single year.\n\nNow, 2017 was also notable for being the third-warmest year on record. This warming trend is closely linked to the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events we saw throughout the year. Hurricanes, wildfires, floods—these disasters not only caused widespread destruction but also came with an unprecedented price tag.\n\nBreaking it down step by step, the high costs reflect both the severity of the events and the extensive damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses. The combination of rising temperatures and changing climate patterns can intensify storms and prolong droughts, making these disasters more severe and costly.\n\nIn summary, 2017 serves as a clear example of how climate factors are influencing the scale and expense of natural disasters in the U.S. The record $306 billion in damages highlights the growing economic risks tied to our changing environment.\n\nThanks for joining me today to explore these important insights.

With cities expanding and industries spreading, China is facing growing pressure on its agricultural land, which is vital for feeding its massive population.\n\nSo, what’s happening? The Chinese government has introduced new measures to hold local officials accountable for safeguarding farmland. Local governments now have clear responsibilities: they must protect the arable land within their areas and work on improving soil quality. The central government is tying funding for soil cleanup projects directly to how well these local authorities perform in protecting their land.\n\nBut it doesn’t stop there. Protecting farmland has become a key factor in evaluating local officials. If they fail to meet these standards, it could hurt their chances for promotion or even lead to dismissal. This shows just how seriously China is taking food security as part of its political priorities.\n\nWhy is this so important? China has to feed nearly a quarter of the world’s population but has only about 7 percent of the world’s arable land. Urbanization and industrial growth have been encroaching on farming areas, and pollution has made some land unusable. On top of that, environmental efforts aimed at increasing forest coverage and creating “ecological red lines” will restrict development on large parts of the country, which could further limit available farmland.\n\nIn short, China is stepping up to protect its farmland by making local officials responsible and linking their performance to real consequences. It’s a clear sign that maintaining food production amid rapid change is a top priority.\n\nThat’s the story behind China’s latest push to safeguard its agricultural future — balancing growth with the need to keep enough healthy land to feed its people."}]}

The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter, both companies said.\nPTTEP is the upstream arm of oil giant PTT Pcl and currently operates the Bongkot field, which produces about 860 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 26,000 barrels per day of condensate.\nThe acquisition is in line with PTTEP’s strategy of adding producing assets or those which are in the final stage of development, located in Southeast Asia where PTTEP has experience, Chief Executive Officer Somporn Vongvuthipornchai said in a statement.\nPTTEP is keen to continue as the field’s operator and plans to participate in a bidding round for the Bongkot concession which expires in 2022-2023 to maintain Thailand’s energy security, Somporn said.\nAndrew Harwood, research director of Asia Pacific upstream oil and gas at ‎Wood Mackenzie, said the lower sale price for the asset probably reflects PTTEP taking on a larger share of future decommissioning liabilities.\n“The deal also puts PTTEP in a stronger position ahead the bidding round, expected to launch by mid-2018,” he said.\nThe sales agreement covers Shell’s 22.2 percent stake in Blocks 15, 16 and 17 and Block G12/48, the companies said. PTTEP’s stake will increase to 66.7 percent after the purchase, with the remaining 33.3 percent held by France’s Total, they said.\nThe deal will increase PTTEP’s sales volume by about 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nIn the bidding round set for mid-2018, over 650 million barrels of oil equivalent of resource will be up for grabs in Thailand, including both the expiring Bongkot concession and areas licensed to Chevron Corp.\nChevron operates the nearby Erawan field under a concession set to expire in 2022.\nThe fields have a combined output of 2.2 billion cubic feet a day, making up about 76 percent of the Gulf of Thailand’s output.\nReporting by Florence Tan in SINGAPORE and Chayut Setboonsarng in BANGKOK; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell and Richard Pullin\n \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, we’re diving into a significant development in Southeast Asia’s energy sector involving two major players: Royal Dutch Shell and PTT Exploration & Production, or PTTEP. This story sheds light on shifting ownership of a key natural gas field offshore Thailand and what it means for the region’s energy landscape.\n\nSo, here’s the background. Shell has decided to sell its stake in the Bongkot gas field and nearby areas to PTTEP for $750 million before tax. This follows a previous attempt by Shell to sell the same assets to Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company, or KUFPEC, for $900 million—a deal that ultimately fell through. Shell has noted that these two price tags aren’t directly comparable and hasn’t commented further on the difference.\n\nNow, why does this sale matter? For Shell, it’s part of a broader plan to divest about $30 billion worth of non-core assets, streamlining its portfolio. For PTTEP, which already operates the Bongkot field, this acquisition aligns perfectly with their strategy. They focus on acquiring producing assets or those nearing full development in Southeast Asia—a region where they have strong experience.\n\nTo give you a sense of scale, the Bongkot field produces roughly 860 million cubic feet of natural gas daily, along with 26,000 barrels per day of condensate. After buying Shell’s 22.2 percent share, PTTEP’s stake will increase to nearly 67 percent, with the rest held by France’s Total. This move will boost PTTEP’s sales volume by about 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nPTTEP’s CEO has expressed a clear intention to remain the operator of Bongkot and plans to participate in an upcoming bidding round for the concession, which is set to expire between 2022 and 2023. Maintaining control over this field is seen as crucial for Thailand’s energy security.\n\nAn industry expert points out that the lower sale price compared to the previous deal might reflect PTTEP taking on more future costs related to decommissioning the field when its productive life ends. Still, this purchase strengthens PTTEP’s position ahead of the bidding round expected in mid-2018.\n\nTo put this in context, that upcoming bidding round will cover over 650 million barrels of oil equivalent in resources across Thailand, including not just Bongkot but also areas operated by Chevron nearby. Together, these fields produce about 2.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily—making up roughly three-quarters of output from the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nIn summary, Shell’s sale of its stake in the Bongkot gas field to PTTEP marks a strategic shift for both companies and highlights ongoing efforts to secure and manage vital energy resources in Southeast Asia. It’s a move that underscores regional players’ growing roles and sets the stage for important decisions about Thailand’s energy future in the years ahead."}]}

We'll break down their expected losses, cash position, and what this means as they move forward with their research.\n\nInfinity Pharmaceuticals recently shared some important updates. For 2018, they anticipate a net loss somewhere between 40 and 50 million dollars. That’s a significant figure, but it’s not unusual for companies investing heavily in drug development, where expenses can be high before products reach the market.\n\nAt the end of 2017, Infinity had about 57.6 million dollars in cash and investments. Looking ahead to the end of 2018, they expect this amount to decrease to somewhere between 10 and 20 million dollars. This drop reflects the ongoing costs tied to their research programs and operations.\n\nOne of their key projects is the Phase 1/1B study of a drug called IPI-549. While specific results weren’t detailed here, updating investors on this trial shows the company’s focus remains on advancing their pipeline despite the financial challenges.\n\nSo, what does all this mean? Infinity is navigating the typical path of a biotech firm—balancing significant investment in promising therapies with the financial realities of research and development. Their expected losses and cash burn highlight the risks involved but also their commitment to pushing forward.\n\nIn summary, Infinity Pharmaceuticals expects to operate at a loss in 2018, drawing down on their cash reserves as they continue clinical studies like IPI-549. It’s a snapshot of a company focused on innovation while managing the financial demands that come with it."}]}

(NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $1.31 and net income of $131.8 million for Q4 2017. Full-year 2017 EPS was $2.87 and net income was $291.3 million. Federated's Q4 2017 and full-year 2017 results included $70.4 million of net income, representing $0.70 and $0.69 per share for Q4 2017 and full-year 2017, respectively, resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act).\nManagement believes adjusted EPS and adjusted net income, which are non-GAAP financial measures, are useful measures for investors to evaluate Federated's financial performance. The adjusted measures reflect what earnings would have been had the tax law changes not reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, resulting in a revaluation of Federated's net deferred tax liability. As such, Federated's Q4 2017 adjusted EPS was $0.61, up 17 percent from EPS of $0.52 for Q4 2016, and adjusted net income was $61.4 million, compared to net income of $55.8 million for Q4 2016. Full-year 2017 adjusted EPS was $2.18, up 7 percent from EPS of $2.03 for 2016, and adjusted net income was $220.9 million, compared to net income of $208.9 million for 2016 1 .\nFederated's total managed assets were $397.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, up $31.7 billion or 9 percent from $365.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2016 and up $33.9 billion or 9 percent from $363.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Average managed assets for Q4 2017 were $382.0 billion, up $23.7 billion or 7 percent from $358.3 billion reported for Q4 2016 and up $21.5 billion or 6 percent from $360.5 billion reported for Q3 2017.\n\"In the fourth quarter, investors showed interest in our MDT and Kaufmann small-cap equity strategies,\" said J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer. \"Also, continued investor demand for a range of quality fixed-income products helped fourth-quarter flows into high-yield and multisector bond funds.\"\nFederated's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividend is payable on Feb. 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 8, 2018. During Q4 2017, Federated purchased 197,237 shares of Federated class B common stock for $4.6 million, bringing the total shares of Class B common stock purchased in 2017 to 1,841,800 shares for $47.0 million.\nFederated's equity assets were a record $68.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, up $5.7 billion or 9 percent from $62.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2016 and up $1.0 billion or 1 percent from $67.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Top-selling equity funds on a net basis during Q4 2017 were Federated MDT Small Cap Core Fund, Federated MDT Small Cap Growth Fund, Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund, Federated International Leaders Fund and Federated Muni and Stock Advantage Fund.\nFederated's fixed-income assets were a record $64.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, up $12.9 billion or 25 percent from $51.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2016 and up $11.4 billion or 22 percent from $52.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Federated added $11.2 billion in fixed-income separate account assets in Q4 2017, which included a new advisory mandate from a large public institution. Top-selling fixed-income funds on a net basis during Q4 2017 included Federated Institutional High Yield Bond Fund, Federated Total Return Bond Fund, Federated Ultrashort Bond Fund, Federated Short-Intermediate Total Return Bond Fund and Federated Bond Fund.\nFederated's money market assets were $265.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, up $13.0 billion or 5 percent from $252.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2016 and up $21.4 billion or 9 percent from $243.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2017.

Since Dec. 31, 2016, approximately $21 billion in money market assets have transitioned from Federated funds to Federated separate accounts. Federated's money market separate account assets were $79.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, up $33.9 billion or 74 percent from $45.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2016 and up $13.7 billion or 21 percent from $66.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2017.\nFinancial Summary\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\nRevenue decreased by $11.6 million or 4 percent primarily due to a change in a customer relationship and a change in the mix of average money market assets. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order for those funds to maintain positive or zero net yields (voluntary yield-related fee waivers) and an increase in revenue from higher average equity and fixed-income assets.\nDuring Q4 2017, Federated derived 60 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (43 percent from equity assets and 17 percent from fixed-income assets) and 40 percent from money market assets.\nOperating expenses decreased by $17.6 million or 9 percent primarily due to a decrease in distribution expenses related to a change in a customer relationship and lower average money market fund assets, partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses related to a decrease in voluntary yield-related fee waivers.\nQ4 2017 vs. Q3 2017\nRevenue was flat, while operating expenses decreased by $2.1 million or 1 percent primarily due to a decrease in distribution expenses related to a change in the mix of average money market fund assets partially offset by increased professional service fee expenses.\n2017 vs. 2016\nRevenue decreased by $40.4 million or 4 percent primarily due to a change in the mix of average money market assets and a decrease in revenue resulting from a change in a customer relationship. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in voluntary yield-related fee waivers and an increase in revenue from higher average equity and fixed-income assets.\nDuring 2017, Federated derived 59 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (42 percent from equity assets and 17 percent from fixed-income assets) and 41 percent from money market assets.\nOperating expenses decreased by $46.3 million or 6 percent primarily due to a decrease in distribution expenses related to lower average money market fund assets and a change in a customer relationship, partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses related to a decrease in voluntary yield-related fee waivers. The decrease in operating expenses is also attributable to a decrease in compensation and related expenses resulting from lower incentive compensation.\nNonoperating income, net increased by $5.2 million primarily due to an increase in net investment income principally resulting from related gains recorded on available-for-sale securities.\nFederated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others, including asset levels and mix, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers, expenses and regulatory changes, can significantly impact Federated's business activity levels and financial results.

For the full year, the company earned $2.87 per share and net income totaled $291.3 million. These figures were notably impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This change resulted in a significant one-time tax benefit that boosted Federated’s reported income by about $70 million.\n\nTo provide a clearer picture of its ongoing performance, Federated also shared adjusted earnings that exclude this tax impact. On this basis, earnings per share for the fourth quarter rose 17% compared to the same period in 2016, reaching 61 cents. For the full year, adjusted earnings were $2.18 per share, up 7% from 2016. Adjusted net income followed a similar trend, reflecting steady growth.\n\nLooking at assets under management, Federated ended 2017 with nearly $398 billion, a 9% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven by strong investor interest in several areas. Notably, small-cap equity strategies like MDT and Kaufmann funds attracted attention, as did high-yield and multisector bond funds within their fixed-income offerings.\n\nFederated’s equity assets hit a record $68 billion by year-end, while fixed-income assets reached an all-time high of $64 billion. Money market assets also grew to over $265 billion, though there was some shifting between mutual funds and separate accounts within that category.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was slightly down compared to the previous year, primarily due to changes in customer relationships and asset mix. However, operating expenses also decreased by about 9%, helping to support profitability.\n\nIn summary, Federated Investors demonstrated solid financial health in 2017 with growing assets under management and improved adjusted earnings per share. Despite some shifts in revenue dynamics and regulatory changes affecting taxes, the company maintained steady growth across key investment strategies.\n\nThat wraps up our overview of Federated Investors’ financial results for 2017. It’s a clear example of how large investment managers navigate changing markets and regulatory environments while continuing to serve their clients effectively."}]}

This move isn’t just about management—it could also involve the government taking an ownership stake in the company. It’s a clear indication of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s intent to shake up the long-standing corporate structures that have shaped Saudi Arabia for decades.\n\nTo understand why this is important, it helps to know a bit about the Binladin family. For many years, they’ve been among the wealthiest and most influential families in the kingdom, largely due to their close ties with the ruling authorities. But now, those ties are being tested. The company’s chairman, Bakr bin Laden, who is in his seventies, has been detained since November, marking a dramatic turn in the family’s fortunes.\n\nThis development reflects Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s broader agenda to modernize and reform Saudi Arabia’s economy and governance. By taking direct control over such a major player in the construction sector, the government is signaling its willingness to disrupt traditional alliances and assert more influence over key industries.\n\nIn summary, Saudi Arabia’s move to supervise and possibly acquire part of the Saudi Binladin Group highlights a pivotal moment. It shows how Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is reshaping the kingdom’s business landscape, challenging established power structures as part of his vision for change."}]}

The company announced that because of ongoing discussions between the HRG Group and a special committee from Spectrum’s board, they felt it was appropriate to delay the meeting. \n\nTo break that down a bit, an annual meeting of stockholders is typically when shareholders come together to discuss company performance, vote on key issues, and hear updates from management.

Specifically, we’re looking at Snap’s recent $4 million employee holiday party. That’s right, four million dollars spent on a single company event.\n\nSo, what does this tell us? Well, it raises an interesting question: Is tech becoming the new Wall Street when it comes to lavish spending and high-profile celebrations?\n\nWe’ll break this down by first exploring the scale of Snap’s party. Spending millions on a holiday event isn’t just about having fun—it’s a statement. It reflects the company’s culture, its values, and how it wants to motivate and retain talent. In the tech world, where competition for skilled employees is fierce, creating memorable experiences can be a way to stand out.\n\nNext, we’ll consider the broader implications. Traditionally, Wall Street firms were known for their extravagant parties and bonuses. Now, tech companies seem to be adopting a similar approach, using big events to showcase success and build community among employees.\n\nFinally, we’ll touch on what this might mean for the future. If tech companies continue down this path, we could see a shift in how corporate culture is expressed across industries—one that blends innovation with celebration in new and exciting ways.\n\nIn summary, Snap’s $4 million holiday bash isn’t just about the party itself. It signals a larger trend where tech firms are embracing lavish celebrations as part of their identity, potentially positioning themselves as the new leaders in corporate extravagance. It’s a fascinating glimpse into how success is celebrated in today’s fast-paced tech world."}]}

Christian Petersen Getty Images By Reuters 6:33 AM EST \nJapanese videogames maker Nintendo Co Ltd reported its biggest third-quarter operating profit in eight years, driven by smashing demand for its new Switch games console, and said it expected annual earnings to outstrip its previous estimate. \nGrowing popularity of the hybrid home-portable Switch has led to a near-doubling of Nintendo‘s stock price to nine-year highs since the device’s launch in March. Sales have exceeded initial estimates, on track to beat the lifetime numbers of its predecessor Wii U, leaving suppliers scrambling for parts. \nSwitch console sales will likely hit 15 million units in the year to March and climb to 20 million next year, Nintendo said, fueling hopes of a repeat of the success of the first Wii that debuted in late 2006 and sold more than 100 million units. \n“The momentum for Switch over the last 10 months has been stronger than that of the Wii,” Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima said at an earnings briefing on Wednesday. \n“The key to Switch’s success in the second year will be to attract non-gamers,” he added. \nAnalysts believe Nintendo‘s plan to launch “Labo,” LEGO-style accessories for the console that kids can build themselves on cardboard sheets, could bring in a younger audience. \n“This is exactly the kind of crazy idea that Nintendo is known for which we believe will help expand the company’s audience,” analysts at Macquarie wrote in a recent research note. It will be “appealing to younger audience which has not been addressed by Nintendo for some time.” \nNintendo sold 7.2 million Switch consoles in the three months through December and raised its annual sales forecast by a million from an earlier projection of 14 million units. \nThat already exceeds sales of 13.56 million consoles for the Wii U that was on the market from late 2012 through 2017. \n“Switch sales during the holiday season were stronger than expected in Japan, the United States and Europe,” Kimishima said at the briefing. \nQ3 BLOWS PAST CONSENSUS \nStellar demand for Switch pushed Nintendo‘s operating profit up almost four-fold to 116.50 billion yen ($1.07 billion) for the third quarter. This was the highest ever it has earned for the October-December period since 2009. \nThe results beat consensus estimate of around 67 billion yen from six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nThe Kyoto-based company raised its profit forecast for the year ending March to 160 billion yen, from 120 billion yen, versus analysts’ estimate of 144 billion yen. \nThe company’s annual profit hit a record high of 555 billion yen in the year to March 2009, driven by Wii sales. \nShares of Nintendo closed up 2% before the quarterly results were announced, versus the wider market that closed down about 1%. \nNintendo, which relies heavily on Switch to drive its earnings, is looking to diversify its revenue sources by moving into new areas such as smartphone gaming and theme parks with its roster of popular characters. \nBut its efforts in smartphone gaming have produced lackluster results. \nIt has released four smartphone titles over the last two years, but recently decided to ditch the first one, a social networking service-style application called Miitomo, due to sluggish demand. \nPokemon GO was a phenomenal success, but Nintendo receives profits only through an affiliate which developed the game with a Google spinoff. \n“The smartphone business is yet to become a profit pillar for Nintendo,” Kimishima said. “We still have a lot to do.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT \n>>>\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to today’s episode, where we’re diving into the impressive turnaround Nintendo has experienced recently. If you’ve been paying attention to the gaming world, you might have noticed Nintendo making headlines for some remarkable financial results.

Since its launch, the Switch has captured gamers’ attention by combining a home console and a portable device into one. This hybrid design has not only boosted sales but also nearly doubled Nintendo’s stock price to levels not seen in nine years.\n\nSo, what’s behind this surge? Sales of the Switch are expected to hit 15 million units by March and climb even higher next year, possibly reaching 20 million. To put that in perspective, these numbers are on track to surpass the lifetime sales of Nintendo’s previous console, the Wii U. In fact, the momentum behind the Switch over the past ten months is even stronger than what the original Wii experienced during its early days.\n\nNintendo’s president, Tatsumi Kimishima, highlighted that the next big step for the Switch is attracting people who don’t usually consider themselves gamers. One exciting move is “Labo,” a set of build-it-yourself accessories made from cardboard that lets kids create their own gaming experiences. This kind of inventive idea could help Nintendo reach a younger audience that hasn’t been fully tapped before.\n\nDuring the last quarter alone, Nintendo sold 7.2 million Switch consoles and raised its annual sales forecast from 14 million to 15 million units. This holiday season boost was especially strong across major markets like Japan, the U.S., and Europe.\n\nFinancially, this surge translated into operating profits soaring nearly four times higher than last year for the October to December period—reaching about $1.07 billion. That’s the best quarterly result Nintendo has seen since 2009. The company also raised its profit forecast for the full year, signaling confidence that this upward trend will continue.\n\nWhile the Switch is clearly carrying Nintendo’s growth story right now, the company is also exploring other avenues like smartphone games and theme parks featuring its beloved characters. However, smartphone efforts have been mixed so far. For example, a social app called Miitomo was recently discontinued due to low demand, and while Pokémon GO was a huge hit, Nintendo only earns a share of profits through an affiliate.\n\nIn summary, Nintendo’s recent success largely hinges on the innovative appeal and strong sales of the Switch console. With creative ideas like Labo aiming to broaden their audience even further, Nintendo is poised to keep riding this wave of growth for now—even as it explores new ways to expand beyond traditional gaming.\n\nThanks for listening today as we explored how Nintendo turned things around with a fresh approach to gaming hardware and clever new ideas for reaching players of all ages. Until next time!"}]}

From stock market movements to corporate updates and economic forecasts, there’s a lot happening that could influence investors and businesses alike.\n\nStarting with the stock market, Britain’s FTSE 100 index is expected to open slightly lower by about four points. This comes after it closed 0.45 percent higher the previous day, buoyed by strong performances in the retail sector, particularly Morrisons, which benefited from a positive Christmas trading update.\n\nTurning to some key corporate news, there’s ongoing uncertainty around the sale of Austrian airline Niki to IAG, the owner of British Airways. Despite a recent German court ruling that raised concerns about the deal falling through, the airline’s administrator plans to continue with the agreed sale.\n\nIn pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline’s new CEO announced plans to review Pfizer’s consumer products business. However, he emphasized caution, stating they won’t overpay for any acquisition.\n\nMeanwhile, Noble Group, once Asia’s largest commodities trader, is undergoing significant restructuring due to heavy losses and high debt. This includes shutting down its London oil trading desk and scaling back operations in Asia.\n\nOn the economic front, a major survey paints a subdued picture for Britain’s economy in 2018. Businesses appear cautious ahead of Brexit, suggesting growth may be underwhelming this year.\n\nOil prices are also in focus, reaching their highest levels since 2014. This rise is driven by production cuts led by OPEC and steady demand. Still, analysts warn that markets might be overheating.\n\nFinally, several UK companies are set to release important financial updates today. These include Shoe Zone, Taylor Wimpey, Tullow Oil, Big Yellow Group, Superdry, J Sainsbury, and Pagegroup — all closely watched for insights into their recent performance.\n\nTo sum up, the UK market is navigating a mix of cautious optimism and uncertainty. Corporate moves and economic signals suggest a year of careful watchfulness as businesses and investors adapt to changing conditions both at home and abroad."}]}

No cause of death has yet been established. \nHer mother, three children and bandmates Noel Hogan, Mike Hogan and Fergal Lawler attended the service at Saint Ailbe’s Church in the small rural County Limerick town of Ballybricken in the south-west of Ireland. \n“No words are adequate to describe Dolores or to accurately state the influence for good she has been over the years,” Canon Liam McNamara, a family friend who first met O‘Riordan when she was a teenager, told the mourners. Slideshow (4 Images) \n“The numbers she rescued from the darkness of depression are impossible to count.” \nCandles lit the streets of Ballybricken late on Monday, as her coffin was brought to the church where McNamara said she once sang and played keyboard in the local choir. \nThe mass began with a recording of Ave Maria sung by O‘Riordan and Italian opera star Luciano Pavarotti. A guitar and a platinum disc award - symbols from a musical career that saw The Cranberries sell over 40 million records, second only to U2 among Irish acts - were brought to the alter. \nO‘Riordan, whose hits with The Cranberries such as “Linger” and “Zombie” catapulted her to fame as a shy 22-year-old, was the “voice of her generation,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said last week.
