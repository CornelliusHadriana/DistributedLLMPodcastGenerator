Write a podcast script based strictly on the user text that follows.
Do NOT summarize or restate the task itself.
Produce spoken content only.

RULES:
	•	Purpose in every paragraph
	•	Clear problem statement
	•	2–3 data points per section
	•	Short sentences
	•	Low jargon
	•	Calm, confident tone
	•	Trend + macro framing
	•	No fluff, slogans, or filler
	•	No labels like “host:” or stage directions

OUTPUT STYLE:
A direct podcast monologue, spoken verbatim. So no interaction with the user and no numbered points.
