SoftBank has fully funded OpenAI commitment of $40 billion, according to sources
SoftBank has completed its $40 billion investment commitment to OpenAI, sources told CNBC’s David Faber.

The Japanese investment giant sent over a final $22 billion to $22.5 billion last week, according to sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named in order to discuss details of the transaction.

SoftBank had previously invested $7.5 billion in the ChatGPT maker and syndicated another $11 billion with co-investors, the Japanese conglomerate confirmed in a press release, with the final aggregate commitment at $41 billion. The investment takes SoftBank’s stake in the company to around 11%.

CNBC reported in February that the company was finalizing a $40 billion investment in the Sam Altman-run startup at a $260 billion pre-money valuation.

At the time, Faber reported that the funding would be paid out over a 12-to-24-month period. Some money was slated to support OpenAI’s artificial intelligence infrastructure Stargate joint venture with Oracle
 and SoftBank.

Companies have been spending big in recent months to build out infrastructure to support a frenzy for AI solutions and growing compute needs.

OpenAI has made more than $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments over the next several years, including agreements with chipmakers Nvidia
, Advanced Micro Devices
 and Broadcom
.

Over the years, SoftBank has been betting big on technology and AI companies and was an early investor in chipmaker Nvidia. On Monday, the conglomerate agreed to pay $4 billion for data center investment firm DigitalBridge
 to strengthen its AI push.

Last month, SoftBank liquidated its entire $5.8 billion stake in major AI beneficiary Nvidia
.

A different source familiar with the move to sell the stake told CNBC at the time that the sale, combined with other cash sources, would support its OpenAI investment.

The startup, which is reportedly preparing for an initial public offering, has received billions in funding over the years from tech juggernaut Microsoft
.

Earlier this month, CNBC reported that OpenAI was exploring the potential for a more than $10 billion investment from Amazon
.

Disney
 is also a recent backer, following a $1 billion equity investment deal that allows users of OpenAI’s video generator Sora to generate content with licensed characters such as Mickey Mouse.

 'Better prompts = better results, faster\n' +
      'Working with v0 is like working with a highly skilled teammate who can build anything you need. v0 is more than just a tool, it’s your building partner. And like with any great collaborator, the quality of what you get depends on how clearly you communicate.\n' +
      "The more specific you are, the better v0's output becomes. From our testing, good prompts consistently deliver:\n" +
      'Faster generation time (30-40% faster with less unnecessary code, fewer credits spent)\n' +
      'Smarter UX decisions (v0 understands intent and optimizes accordingly)\n' +
      'Cleaner, more maintainable code\n' +
      'This guide shows you a framework that consistently produces these results.\n' +
      'Link to headingThe framework: Three inputs that drive great prompts\n' +
      "After building hundreds of applications ourselves and learning from v0's power users, we’ve noticed that the best prompts always include three core inputs:\n" +
      'Product surface\n' +
      'Context of use\n' +
      'Constraints & taste\n' +
      "Here's the template:\n" +
      'Build [product surface: components, data, actions].\n' +
      'Used by [who],in [what moment],to [what decision or outcome].\n' +
      'Constraints:- platform / device- visual tone- layout assumptions\n' +
      "Let's break down each input.\n" +
      'Link to headingProduct surface\n' +
      'What specifically are you building?\n' +
      'List the actual components, features, and data. Not “a dashboard”, but what data it shows, what actions users can take, and what the key sections are.\n' +
      'Example:\n' +
      'Dashboard displaying: top 5 performers with names and revenue, team revenue vs quota progress bar, deal pipeline with stages (Leads → Qualified → Demo → Closed), 6-month revenue trend chart.\n' +
      'When you’re specific about the product surface, v0 doesn’t waste time inventing features you don’t need or missing ones you do.\n' +
      'Link to headingContext of use\n' +
      'Who’s using this, and in what moment?\n' +
      'Be specific about your users and how they interact with the product in real life. Their role, technical comfort level, time constraints, and environment shape how v0 designs the UX.\n' +
      'Ask yourself:\n' +
      'Who uses this?\n' +
      'When do they use it?\n' +
      'What decision are they trying to make?\n' +
      'How much time do they have?\n' +
      'Example:\n' +
      'Sales managers (non-technical) who check this during morning standups on desktop monitors to quickly spot underperformers and celebrate wins with the team.\n' +
      'v0 optimizes for assumed usage. If you don’t define the context of use, it will guess.\n' +
      'Link to headingConstraints & taste\n' +
      'How should it work and look\n' +
      'Constraints tell v0 what not to invent.\n' +
      'Include:\n' +
      'Style preferences\n' +
      'Platform or device assumptions\n' +
      'Layout expectations\n' +
      'Color systems\n' +
      'Responsiveness or accessibility needs\n' +
      'Example:\n' +
      'Professional but approachable. Use card-based layout with clear hierarchy. Color code: green for on-track, yellow for at-risk, red for below target. Desktop-first since they use large monitors. Make it feel like a real SaaS product.\n' +
      'v0’s defaults are good. Specific constraints make them great while keeping code cleaner.\n' +
      'Link to headingShow the difference: Real test results\n' +
      'I tested this framework by building the same applications with different levels of context. Each test isolates one element to show its impact:\n' +
      'Link to headingTest 1: The impact of context of use\n' +
      'Without context of use:\n' +
      'Build an e-commerce site with product grid, filters, and shopping features.\n' +
      'v0 chat: https://v0.link/6vSzuSI\n' +
      'With context of use:\n' +
      'Fashion e-commerce site targeting millennials (25-35) who browse on mobile during commutes. They compare multiple items quickly before buying. Build a product page with: swipeable image gallery, product title, price, description, size/color selectors, add to cart button. Include minimal header with back button and cart icon. Clean, premium aesthetic.\n' +
      'v0 chat: https://v0.link/CcOTmsI\n' +
      'What changed:\n' +
      'The version with context took 26 seconds longer but delivered a completely functional product. The version without context had:\n' +
      'Non-functional search (placeholder only)\n' +
      'Non-functional cart\n' +
      'NOT responsive\n' +
      'The version with context had:\n' +
      'Fully functional search and cart with quantity controls\n' +
      '100% mobile responsive\n' +
      'Sophisticated mobile-first design\n' +
      'Quick view modals and category filters\n' +
      'The real cost:\n' +
      'Without context would have required 1-2 more prompts to add the missing functionality, totaling ~5 minutes and ~1.5 credits. Better context saved multiple iterations.\n' +
      'Link to headingTest 2: The impact of product surface\n' +
      'Vague product surface:\n' +
      'Build a user profile page.\n' +
      'v0 chat: https://v0.link/1Gev1Gi\n' +
      'Specific product surface:\n' +
      'Build a user profile page showing: profile photo, display name, username, email, bio, member since date, activity stats (posts, comments, followers), recent activity feed with timestamps, edit profile and settings buttons.\n' +
      'v0 chat: https://v0.link/690wE6f\n' +
      'Results:\n' +
      'Vague: 1m 38s, 595 lines, 0.173 credits\n' +
      'Specific: 1m 19s, 443 lines, 0.160 credits\n' +
      '19 seconds faster, 152 fewer lines, lower cost.\n' +
      'The vague prompt forced v0 to guess. The specific prompt generated exactly what we needed: all requested fields properly structured, activity stats prominent, correct information architecture.\n' +
      'When the product surface is explicit, v0 doesn’t waste time inventing features you don’t need or missing ones you do.\n' +
      'Link to headingTest 3: The impact of constraints & taste\n' +
      'Basic constraints:\n' +
      'Build a support ticket dashboard. Shows: open tickets, response time, agent performance, recent activity.\n' +
      'v0 chat: https://v0.link/jrNW2FX\n' +
      'Detailed constraints:\n' +
      'Build a support ticket dashboard. Shows: open tickets, response time, agent performance, recent activity.\n' +
      'Mobile-first design (team leads check this on phones while on the floor).Light theme, high contrast. Color code: red for urgent (>24h), yellow for medium, green for on-time. Maximum3-column layout. Include loading states for real-time data.\n' +
      'v0 chat: https://v0.link/ZtsFTeb\n' +
      'Results:\n' +
      'Basic: 1m 42s, 679 lines, 0.133 credits\n' +
      'Detailed: 1m 52s, 569 lines, 0.130 credits\n' +
      'Took 10 seconds longer but generated 110 fewer lines and cost less.\n' +
      'The difference: basic version "works on mobile" (desktop layout that shrinks). Detailed version is "mobile-first" (designed from the ground up for mobile, single column expanding to 3 max, intentional color coding with red/yellow/green urgency levels, agent status badges, high contrast for outdoor visibility).\n' +
      "v0's defaults are good. Specific constraints make them great while keeping code cleaner.\n" +
      'Link to headingIterating on your generations\n' +
      'Once v0 generates your app, you have two main ways to iterate:\n' +
      'Prompt for changes: Describe what you want to change, add, or remove. Best for functional changes, adding features, or restructuring layouts.\n' +
      'Design Mode: Click Design Mode, select any element visually, and adjust properties directly. Faster for quick visual changes like colors, spacing, or typography.\n' +
      'Use prompts for logic and structure. Use Design Mode for visual tweaks.\n' +
      'Link to headingQuick reference: Prompt template\n' +
      "Here's the template again, this time with a fully expanded example:\n" +
      'Template:\n' +

      'Used by [who],in [what moment],to [what decision or outcome].\n' +
      'Constraints:- platform / device- visual tone- layout assumptions\n' +
      'Example:\n' +
      'Build a support dashboard showing: open tickets count,average response time, tickets by priority (high/medium/low),agent performance list with current workload, recent ticket activity feed.\n' +
      'Used by support team leads (managing 5–10 agents),on their phones while walking the floor,to prevent agent burnout and maintain response-time SLAs.Checked every 30 minutes to identify overloaded agentsand redistribute work.\n' +
      'Constraints:Mobile-first, light theme, high contrast.Color code by priority: red for urgent, yellow for medium, green for low.Show agent status badges (busy/available).Maximum 2 columns on mobile.\n' +
      'Ready to build?\n' +
